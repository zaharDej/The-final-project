von kempelen and his discovery after the very minute and elaborate paper arago say nothing the summary silliman journal with the detailed statement just published lieutenant maury will not supposed course that offering few hurried remarks reference von kempelen discovery have any design look the subject scientific point view object simply the first place say few words von kempelen himself with whom some years ago had the honor slight personal acquaintance since every thing which concerns him must necessarily this moment interest and the second place look general way and speculatively the results the discovery may well however premise the cursory observations which have offer denying very decidedly what seems general impression gleaned usual case this kind from the newspapers viz that this discovery astounding unquestionably unanticipated reference the diary sir humphrey davy cottle and munroe london will seen and that this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now question but had actually made inconsiderable progress experimentally the very identical analysis now triumphantly brought issue von kempelen who although makes not the slightest allusion without doubt say unhesitatingly and can prove required indebted the diary for least the first hint his own undertaking the paragraph from the courier and enquirer which now going the rounds the press and which purports claim the invention for kissam brunswick maine appears confess little apocryphal for several reasons although there nothing either impossible very improbable the statement made need not into details opinion the paragraph founded principally upon its manner does not look true persons who are narrating facts are seldom particular kissam seems about day and date and precise location besides kissam actually did come upon the discovery says did the period designated nearly eight years ago how happens that took steps the instant reap the immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have resulted him individually not the world large from the discovery seems quite incredible that any man common understanding could have discovered what kissam says did and yet have subsequently acted like baby like owl kissam admits that did the way who kissam and not the whole paragraph the courier and enquirer fabrication got make talk must confessed that has amazingly moon hoaxy air very little dependence placed upon humble opinion and were not well aware from experience how very easily men science are mystified points out their usual range inquiry should profoundly astonished finding eminent chemist professor draper discussing kissam quizzem pretensions the discovery serious tone but return the diary sir humphrey davy this pamphlet was not designed for the public eye even upon the decease the writer any person all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself once the slightest inspection the style page for example near the middle read reference his researches about the protoxide azote less than half minute the respiration being continued diminished gradually and were succeeded analogous gentle pressure all the muscles that the respiration was not diminished not only clear the subsequent context but the use the plural were the sentence doubt was thus intended less than half minute the respiration being continued these feelings diminished gradually and were succeeded sensation analogous gentle pressure all the muscles hundred similar instances show that the inconsiderately published was merely rough note book meant only for the writer own eye but inspection the pamphlet will convince almost any thinking person the truth suggestion the fact sir humphrey davy was about the last man the world commit himself scientific topics not only had more than ordinary dislike quackery but was morbidly afraid appearing empirical that however fully might have been convinced that was the right track the matter now question would never have spoken out until had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched could have suspected that his wishes regard burning this diary full crude speculations would have been unattended seems they were say his wishes for that meant include this note book among the miscellaneous papers directed burnt think there can manner doubt whether escaped the flames good fortune bad yet remains seen that the passages quoted above with the other similar ones referred gave von kempelen the hint not the slightest degree question but repeat yet remains seen whether this momentous discovery itself momentous under any circumstances will service disservice mankind large that von kempelen and his immediate friends will reap rich harvest would folly doubt for moment they will scarcely weak not realize time large purchases houses and land with other property intrinsic value the brief account von kempelen which appeared the home journal and has since been extensively copied several misapprehensions the german original seem have been made the translator who professes have taken the passage from late number the presburg schnellpost viele has evidently been misconceived often and what the translator renders sorrows probably lieden which its true version sufferings would give totally different complexion the whole account but course much this merely guess part von kempelen however means misanthrope appearance least whatever may fact acquaintance with him was casual altogether and scarcely warranted saying that know him all but have seen and conversed with man prodigious notoriety has attained will attain few days not small matter times the literary world speaks him confidently native presburg misled perhaps the account the home journal but pleased being able state positively since have from his own lips that was born utica the state new york although both his parents believe are presburg descent the family connected some way with elzel automaton chess player memory person short and stout with large fat blue eyes sandy hair and whiskers wide but pleasing mouth fine teeth and

sojourners for week about six years ago earl hotel providence rhode island and presume that conversed with him various times for some three four hours altogether his principal topics were those the day and nothing that fell from him led suspect his scientific attainments left the hotel before intending new york and thence bremen was the latter city that his great discovery was first made public rather was there that was first suspected having made this about all that personally know the now immortal von kempelen but have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public there can little question that most the marvellous rumors afloat about this affair are pure inventions entitled about much credit the story aladdin lamp and yet case this kind the case the discoveries california clear that the truth may stranger than fiction the following anecdote least well authenticated that may receive implicitly von kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence bremen and often was well known had been put extreme shifts order raise trifling sums when the great excitement occurred about the forgery the house gutsmuth suspicion was directed toward von kempelen account his having purchased considerable property gasperitch lane and his refusing when questioned explain how became possessed the purchase money was length arrested but nothing decisive appearing against him was the end set liberty the police however kept strict watch upon his movements and thus discovered that left home frequently taking always the same road and invariably giving his watchers the slip the neighborhood that labyrinth narrow and crooked passages known the flash name the dondergat finally dint great perseverance they traced him garret old house seven stories alley called flatzplatz and coming upon him suddenly found him they imagined the midst his counterfeiting operations his agitation represented excessive that the officers had not the slightest doubt his guilt after hand cuffing him they searched his room rather rooms for appears occupied all the mansarde opening into the garret where they caught him was closet ten feet eight fitted with some chemical apparatus which the object has not yet been ascertained one corner the closet was very small furnace with glowing fire and the fire kind duplicate crucible two crucibles connected tube one these crucibles was nearly full lead state fusion but not reaching the aperture the tube which was close the brim the other crucible had some liquid which the officers entered seemed furiously dissipating vapor they relate that finding himself taken kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands which were encased gloves that afterwards turned out asbestic and threw the contents the tiled floor was now that they hand cuffed him and before proceeding ransack the premises they searched his person but nothing unusual was found about him excepting paper parcel his coat pocket containing what was afterward ascertained mixture antimony and some unknown substance nearly but not quite equal proportions all attempts analyzing the unknown substance have far failed but that will ultimately analyzed not doubted passing out the closet with their prisoner the officers went through sort ante chamber which nothing material was found the chemist sleeping room they here rummaged some drawers and boxes but discovered only few papers importance and some good coin silver and gold length looking under the bed they saw large common hair trunk without hinges hasp lock and with the top lying carelessly across the bottom portion upon attempting draw this trunk out from under the bed they found that with their united strength there were three them all powerful men they could not stir one inch much astonished this one them crawled under the bed and looking into the trunk said wonder couldn move why full the brim old bits brass putting his feet now against the wall get good purchase and pushing with all his force while his companions pulled with all theirs the trunk with much difficulty was slid out from under the bed and its contents examined the supposed brass with which was filled was all small smooth pieces varying from the size pea that dollar but the pieces were irregular shape although more less flat looking upon the whole very much lead looks when thrown upon the ground molten state and there suffered grow cool now not one these officers for moment suspected this metal anything but brass the idea its being gold never entered their brains course how could such wild fancy have entered and their astonishment may well conceived when the next day became known all over bremen that the lot brass which they had carted contemptuously the police office without putting themselves the trouble pocketing the smallest scrap was not only gold real gold but gold far finer than any employed coinage gold fact absolutely pure virgin without the slightest appreciable alloy need not over the details von kempelen confession far went and release for these are familiar the public that has actually realized spirit and effect not the letter the old chimaera the philosopher stone sane person liberty doubt the opinions arago are course entitled the greatest consideration but means infallible and what says bismuth his report the academy must taken cum grano salis the simple truth that this period all analysis has failed and until von kempelen chooses let have the key his own published enigma more than probable that the matter will remain for years statu quo all that yet can fairly said known that pure gold can made will and very readily from lead connection with certain other substances kind and proportions unknown speculation course busy the immediate and ultimate results this discovery discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate referring increased interest the matter gold generally the late developments california and this reflection brings inevitably another the exceeding inopportuneness von kempelen analysis many were prevented from adventuring california the mere apprehension that gold would materially diminish value account its plentifulness the mines there render the speculation going far search doubtful one what impression will wrought now upon the minds those about emigrate and especially upon the minds those actually the mineral region the announcement this astounding discovery von kempelen discovery which declares many words that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes whatever that worth may gold now least soon will for cannot supposed that von kempelen can long retain his secret greater value than lead and far inferior value silver indeed exceedingly difficult speculate prospectively upon the consequences the discovery but one thing may positively maintained that the announcement the discovery six months ago would have had material influence regard the settlement california europe yet the most noticeable results have been rise two hundred per cent the price lead and nearly twenty five per cent that silver
