the thousand and second tale scheherazade truth stranger than fiction old saying having had occasion lately the course some oriental investigations consult the tellmenow isits ornot work which like the zohar simeon jochaides scarcely known all even europe and which has never been quoted knowledge any american except perhaps the author the curiosities american literature having had occasion say turn over some pages the first mentioned very remarkable work was not little astonished discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely error respecting the fate the vizier daughter scheherazade that fate depicted the arabian nights and that the nouement there given not altogether inaccurate far goes least blame not having gone very much farther for full information this interesting topic must refer the inquisitive reader the isits ornot itself but the meantime shall pardoned for giving summary what there discovered will remembered that the usual version the tales certain monarch having good cause jealous his queen not only puts her death but makes vow his beard and the prophet espouse each night the most beautiful maiden his dominions and the next morning deliver her the executioner having fulfilled this vow for many years the letter and with religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him man devout feeling and excellent sense was interrupted one afternoon doubt his prayers visit from his grand vizier whose daughter appears there had occurred idea her name was scheherazade and her idea was that she would either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty perish after the approved fashion all heroines the attempt accordingly and although not find leap year which makes the sacrifice more meritorious she deputes her father the grand vizier make offer the king her hand this hand the king eagerly accepts had intended take all events and had put off the matter from day day only through fear the vizier but accepting now gives all parties very distinctly understand that grand vizier grand vizier has not the slightest design giving one iota his vow his privileges when therefore the fair scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king and did actually marry him despite her father excellent advice not any thing the kind when she would and did marry him say will nill was with her beautiful black eyes thoroughly open the nature the case would allow seems however that this politic damsel who had been reading machiavelli beyond doubt had very ingenious little plot her mind the night the wedding she contrived upon forget what specious pretence have her sister occupy couch sufficiently near that the royal pair admit easy conversation from bed bed and little before cock crowing she took care awaken the good monarch her husband who bore her none the worse will because intended wring her neck the morrow she managed awaken him say although account capital conscience and easy digestion slept well the profound interest story about rat and black cat think which she was narrating all undertone course her sister when the day broke happened that this history was not altogether finished and that scheherazade the nature things could not finish just then since was high time for her get and bowstrung thing very little more pleasant than hanging only trifle more genteel the king curiosity however prevailing sorry say even over his sound religious principles induced him for this once postpone the fulfilment his vow until next morning for the purpose and with the hope hearing that night how fared the end with the black cat black cat think was and the rat the night having arrived however the lady scheherazade not only put the finishing stroke the black cat and the rat the rat was blue but before she well knew what she was about found herself deep the intricacies narration having reference not altogether mistaken pink horse with green wings that went violent manner clockwork and was wound with indigo key with this history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the other and the day broke before its conclusion notwithstanding all the queen endeavors get through with time for the bowstringing there was again resource but postpone that ceremony before for twenty four hours the next night there happened similar accident with similar result and then the next and then again the next that the end the good monarch having been unavoidably deprived all opportunity keep his vow during period less than one thousand and one nights either forgets altogether the expiration this time gets himself absolved the regular way what more probable breaks outright well the head his father confessor all events scheherazade who being lineally descended from eve fell heir perhaps the whole seven baskets talk which the latter lady all know picked from under the trees the garden eden scheherazade say finally triumphed and the tariff upon beauty was repealed now this conclusion which that the story have upon record doubt excessively proper and pleasant but alas like great many pleasant things more pleasant than true and indebted altogether the isits ornot for the means correcting the error mieux says french proverb est ennemi bien and mentioning that scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets talk should have added that she put them out compound interest until they amounted seventy seven dear sister said she the thousand and second night quote the language the isits ornot this point verbatim dear sister said she now that all this little difficulty about the bowstring has blown over and that this odious tax happily repealed feel that have been guilty great indiscretion withholding from you and the king who sorry say snores thing gentleman would the full conclusion sinbad the sailor this person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which related but the truth felt sleepy the particular night their narration and was seduced into cutting them short grievous piece misconduct for which only trust that allah will forgive but even yet not too late remedy great neglect and soon have given the king pinch two order wake him far that may stop making that horrible noise will forthwith entertain you and him pleases with the sequel this very remarkable story hereupon the sister scheherazade have from the isits ornot expressed very particular intensity gratification but the king having been sufficiently pinched length ceased snoring and finally said hum and then hoo when the queen understanding these words which are doubt arabic signify that was all attention and would his best not snore any more the queen say having arranged these matters her satisfaction entered thus once into the history sinbad the sailor length old age these are the words sinbad himself retailed scheherazade length old age and after enjoying many years tranquillity home became once more possessed desire visiting foreign countries and one day without acquainting any family with design packed some bundles such merchandise was most precious and least bulky and engaging porter carry them went with him down the sea shore await the arrival any chance vessel that might convey out the kingdom into some region which had not yet explored having deposited the packages upon the sands sat down beneath some trees and looked out into the ocean the hope perceiving ship but during several hours saw none whatever length fancied that could hear singular buzzing humming sound and the porter after listening awhile declared that also could distinguish presently grew louder and then still louder that could have doubt that the object which caused was approaching length the edge the horizon discovered black speck which rapidly increased size until made out vast monster swimming with great part its body above the surface the sea came toward with inconceivable swiftness throwing huge waves foam around its breast and illuminating all that part the sea through which passed with long line fire that extended far off into the distance the thing drew near saw very distinctly its length was equal that three the loftiest trees that grow and was wide the great hall audience your palace most sublime and munificent the caliphs its body which was unlike that ordinary fishes was solid rock and jetty blackness throughout all that portion which floated above the water with the exception narrow blood red streak that completely begirdled the belly which floated beneath the surface and which could get only glimpse now and then the monster rose and fell with the billows was entirely covered with metallic scales color like that the moon misty weather the back was flat and nearly white and from there extended upwards six spines about half the length the whole body this horrible creature had mouth that could perceive but make for this deficiency was provided with least four score eyes that protruded from their sockets like those the green dragon fly and were arranged all around the body two rows one above the other and parallel the blood red streak which seemed answer the purpose eyebrow two three these dreadful eyes were much larger than the others and had the appearance solid gold although this beast approached have before said with the greatest rapidity must have been moved altogether necromancy for had neither fins like fish nor web feet like duck nor wings like the seashell which blown along the manner vessel nor yet did writhe itself forward the eels its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike only not far from the latter were two small holes that served for nostrils and through which the monster puffed out its thick breath with prodigious violence and with shrieking disagreeable noise our terror beholding this hideous thing was very great but was even surpassed our astonishment when upon getting nearer look perceived upon the creature back vast number animals about the size and shape men and altogether much resembling them except that they wore garments men being supplied nature doubt with ugly uncomfortable covering good deal like cloth but fitting tight the skin render the poor wretches laughably awkward and put them apparently severe pain the very tips their heads were certain square looking boxes which first sight thought might have been intended answer turbans but soon discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid and therefore concluded they were contrivances designed their great weight keep the heads the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders around the necks the creatures were fastened black collars badges servitude doubt such keep our dogs only much wider and infinitely stiffer that was quite impossible for these poor victims move their heads any direction without moving the body the same time and thus they were doomed perpetual contemplation their noses view puggish and snubby wonderful not positively awful degree when the monster had nearly reached the shore where stood suddenly pushed out one its eyes great extent and emitted from terrible flash fire accompanied dense cloud smoke and noise that can compare nothing but thunder the smoke cleared away saw one the odd man animals standing near the head the large beast with trumpet his hand through which putting his mouth presently addressed loud harsh and disagreeable accents that perhaps should have mistaken for language had they not come altogether through the nose being thus evidently spoken was loss how reply could manner understand what was said and this difficulty turned the porter who was near swooning through affright and demanded him his opinion what species monster was what wanted and what kind creatures those were that swarmed upon its back this the porter replied well could for trepidation that had once before heard this sea beast that was cruel demon with bowels sulphur and blood fire created evil genii the means inflicting misery upon mankind that the things upon its back were vermin such sometimes infest cats and dogs only little larger and more savage and that these vermin had their uses however evil for through the torture they caused the beast their nibbling and stingings was goaded into that degree wrath which was requisite make roar and commit ill and fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs the wicked genii this account determined take heels and without once even looking behind ran full speed into the hills while the porter ran equally fast although nearly opposite direction that these means finally made his escape with bundles which have doubt took excellent care although this point cannot determine not remember that ever beheld him again for myself was hotly pursued swarm the men vermin who had come the shore boats that was very soon overtaken bound hand and foot and conveyed the beast which immediately swam out again into the middle the sea now bitterly repented folly quitting comfortable home peril life such adventures this but regret being useless made the best condition and exerted myself secure the goodwill the man animal that owned the trumpet and who appeared exercise authority over his fellows succeeded well this endeavor that few days the creature bestowed upon various tokens his favor and the end even went the trouble teaching the rudiments what was vain enough denominate its language that length was enabled converse with readily and came make comprehend the ardent desire had seeing the world washish squashish squeak sinbad hey diddle diddle grunt unt grumble hiss fiss whiss said one day after dinner but beg thousand pardons had forgotten that your majesty not conversant with the dialect the cock neighs the man animals were called presume because their language formed the connecting link between that the horse and that the rooster with your permission will translate washish squashish and forth that say happy find dear sinbad that you are really very excellent fellow are now about doing thing which called circumnavigating the globe and since you are desirous seeing the world will strain point and give you free passage upon back the beast when the lady scheherazade had proceeded thus far relates the isits ornot the king turned over from his left side his right and said fact very surprising dear queen that you omitted hitherto these latter adventures sinbad you know think them exceedingly entertaining and strange the king having thus expressed himself are told the fair scheherazade resumed her history the following words sinbad went this manner with his narrative thanked the man animal for its kindness and soon found myself very much home the beast which swam prodigious rate through the ocean although the surface the latter that part the world means flat but round like pomegranate that went say either hill down hill all the time that think was very singular interrupted the king nevertheless quite true replied scheherazade have doubts rejoined the king but pray good with the story will said the queen the beast continued sinbad the caliph swam have related hill and down hill until length arrived island many hundreds miles circumference but which nevertheless had been built the middle the sea colony little things like caterpillars hum said the king leaving this island said sinbad for scheherazade must understood took notice her husband ill mannered ejaculation leaving this island came another where the forests were solid stone and hard that they shivered pieces the finest tempered axes with which endeavoured cut them down hum said the king again but scheherazade paying him attention continued the language sinbad passing beyond this last island reached country where there was cave that ran the distance thirty forty miles within the bowels the earth and that contained greater number far more spacious and more magnificent palaces than are found all damascus and bagdad from the roofs these palaces there hung myriads gems like diamonds but larger than men and among the streets towers and pyramids and temples there flowed immense rivers black ebony and swarming with fish that had eyes hum said the king then swam into region the sea where found lofty mountain down whose sides there streamed torrents melted metal some which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long while from abyss the summit issued vast quantity ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens and became darker than the darkest midnight that when were even the distance hundred and fifty miles from the mountain was impossible see the whitest object however close held our eyes hum said the king after quitting this coast the beast continued his voyage until met with land which the nature things seemed reversed for here saw great lake the bottom which more than hundred feet beneath the surface the water there flourished full leaf forest tall and luxuriant trees hoo said the king some hundred miles farther brought climate where the atmosphere was dense sustain iron steel just our own does feather fiddle dee said the king proceeding still the same direction presently arrived the most magnificent region the whole world through there meandered glorious river for several thousands miles this river was unspeakable depth and transparency richer than that amber was from three six miles width and its banks which arose either side twelve hundred feet perpendicular height were crowned with ever blossoming trees and perpetual sweet scented flowers that made the whole territory one gorgeous garden but the name this luxuriant land was the kingdom horror and enter was inevitable death humph said the king left this kingdom great haste and after some days came another where were astonished perceive myriads monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads these hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns the soil funnel shape and line the sides them with rocks disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly when trodden upon other animals thus precipitating them into the monster dens where their blood immediately sucked and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out immense distance from the caverns death pooh said the king continuing our progress perceived district with vegetables that grew not upon any soil but the air there were others that sprang from the substance other vegetables others that derived their substance from the bodies living animals and then again there were others that glowed all over with intense fire others that moved from place place pleasure and what was still more wonderful discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved their limbs will and had moreover the detestable passion mankind for enslaving other creatures and confining them horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment appointed tasks pshaw said the king quitting this land soon arrived another which the bees and the birds are mathematicians such genius and erudition that they give daily instructions the science geometry the wise men the empire the king the place having offered reward for the solution two very difficult problems they were solved upon the spot the one the bees and the other the birds but the king keeping their solution secret was only after the most profound researches and labor and the writing infinity big books during long series years that the men mathematicians length arrived the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot the bees and the birds said the king had scarcely lost sight this empire when found ourselves close upon another from whose shores there flew over our heads flock fowls mile breadth and two hundred and forty miles long that although they flew mile during every minute required less than four hours for the whole flock pass over which there were several millions millions fowl said the king sooner had got rid these birds which occasioned great annoyance than were terrified the appearance fowl another kind and infinitely larger than even the rocs which met former voyages for was bigger than the biggest the domes your seraglio most munificent caliphs this terrible fowl had head that could perceive but was fashioned entirely belly which was prodigious fatness and roundness soft looking substance smooth shining and striped with various colors its talons the monster was bearing away his eyrie the heavens house from which had knocked off the roof and the interior which distinctly saw human beings who beyond doubt were state frightful despair the horrible fate which awaited them shouted with all our might the hope frightening the bird into letting its prey but merely gave snort puff rage and then let fall upon our heads heavy sack which proved filled with sand stuff said the king was just after this adventure that encountered continent immense extent and prodigious solidity but which nevertheless was supported entirely upon the back sky blue cow that had fewer than four hundred horns that now believe said the king because have read something the kind before book passed immediately beneath this continent swimming between the legs the cow and after some hours found ourselves wonderful country indeed which was informed the man animal was his own native land inhabited things his own species this elevated the man animal very much esteem and fact now began feel ashamed the contemptuous familiarity with which had treated him for found that the man animals general were nation the most powerful magicians who lived with worms their brain which doubt served stimulate them their painful writhings and wrigglings the most miraculous efforts imagination nonsense said the king among the magicians were domesticated several animals very singular kinds for example there was huge horse whose bones were iron and whose blood was boiling water place corn had black stones for his usual food and yet spite hard diet was strong and swift that would drag load more weighty than the grandest temple this city rate surpassing that the flight most birds twattle said the king saw also among these people hen without feathers but bigger than camel instead flesh and bone she had iron and brick her blood like that the horse whom fact she was nearly related was boiling water and like him she ate nothing but wood black stones this hen brought forth very frequently hundred chickens the day and after birth they took their residence for several weeks within the stomach their mother fal lal said the king one this nation mighty conjurors created man out brass and wood and leather and endowed him with such ingenuity that would have beaten chess all the race mankind with the exception the great caliph haroun alraschid another these magi constructed like material creature that put shame even the genius him who made for great were its reasoning powers that second performed calculations vast extent that they would have required the united labor fifty thousand fleshy men for year but still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself mighty thing that was neither man nor beast but which had brains lead intermixed with black matter like pitch and fingers that employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that would have had trouble writing out twenty thousand copies the koran hour and this with exquisite precision that all the copies there should not found one vary from another the breadth the finest hair this thing was prodigious strength that erected overthrew the mightiest empires breath but its powers were exercised equally for evil and for good ridiculous said the king among this nation necromancers there was also one who had his veins the blood the salamanders for made scruple sitting down smoke his chibouc red hot oven until his dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor another had the faculty converting the common metals into gold without even looking them during the process another had such delicacy touch that made wire fine invisible another had such quickness perception that counted all the separate motions elastic body while was springing backward and forward the rate nine hundred millions times second absurd said the king another these magicians means fluid that nobody ever yet saw could make the corpses his friends brandish their arms kick out their legs fight even get and dance his will another had cultivated his voice great extent that could have made himself heard from one end the world the other another had long arm that could sit down damascus and indite letter bagdad indeed any distance whatsoever another commanded the lightning come down him out the heavens and came his call and served him for plaything when came another took two loud sounds and out them made silence another constructed deep darkness out two brilliant lights another made ice red hot furnace another directed the sun paint his portrait and the sun did another took this luminary with the moon and the planets and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy probed into their depths and found out the solidity the substance which they were made but the whole nation indeed surprising necromantic ability that not even their infants nor their commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty seeing objects that not exist all that for twenty millions years before the birth the nation itself had been blotted out from the face creation preposterous said the king the wives and daughters these incomparably great and wise magi continued scheherazade without being any manner disturbed these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions the part her husband the wives and daughters these eminent conjurers are every thing that accomplished and refined and would every thing that interesting and beautiful but for unhappy fatality that besets them and from which not even the miraculous powers their husbands and fathers has hitherto been adequate save some fatalities come certain shapes and some others but this which speak has come the shape crotchet what said the king crotchet said scheherazade one the evil genii who are perpetually upon the watch inflict ill has put into the heads these accomplished ladies that the thing which describe personal beauty consists altogether the protuberance the region which lies not very far below the small the back perfection loveliness they say the direct ratio the extent this lump having been long possessed this idea and bolsters being cheap that country the days have long gone since was possible distinguish woman from dromedary stop said the king can stand that and won you have already given dreadful headache with your lies the day too perceive beginning break how long have been married conscience getting troublesome again and then that dromedary touch you take for fool upon the whole you might well get and throttled these words learn from the isits ornot both grieved and astonished scheherazade but she knew the king man scrupulous integrity and quite unlikely forfeit his word she submitted her fate with good grace she derived however great consolation during the tightening the bowstring from the reflection that much the history remained still untold and that the petulance her brute husband had reaped for him most righteous reward depriving him many inconceivable adventures
