mesmeric revelation whatever doubt may still envelop the rationale mesmerism its startling facts are now almost universally admitted these latter those who doubt are your mere doubters profession unprofitable and disreputable tribe there can more absolute waste time than the attempt prove the present day that man mere exercise will can impress his fellow cast him into abnormal condition which the phenomena resemble very closely those death least resemble them more nearly than they the phenomena any other normal condition within our cognizance that while this state the person impressed employs only with effort and then feebly the external organs sense yet perceives with keenly refined perception and through channels supposed unknown matters beyond the scope the physical organs that moreover his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated that his sympathies with the person impressing him are profound and finally that his susceptibility the impression increases with its frequency while the same proportion the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced say that these which are the laws mesmerism its general features would supererogation demonstrate nor shall inflict upon readers needless demonstration day purpose present very different one indeed impelled even the teeth world prejudice detail without comment the very remarkable substance colloquy occurring between sleep waker and myself had been long the habit mesmerizing the person question vankirk and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation the mesmeric perception had supervened for many months had been laboring under confirmed phthisis the more distressing effects which had been relieved manipulations and the night wednesday the fifteenth instant was summoned his bedside the invalid was suffering with acute pain the region the heart and breathed with great difficulty having all the ordinary symptoms asthma spasms such these had usually found relief from the application mustard the nervous centres but night this had been attempted vain entered his room greeted with cheerful smile and although evidently much bodily pain appeared mentally quite ease sent for you night said not much administer bodily ailment satisfy concerning certain psychal impressions which late have occasioned much anxiety and surprise need not tell you how sceptical have hitherto been the topic the soul immortality cannot deny that there has always existed that very soul which have been denying vague half sentiment its own existence but this half sentiment time amounted conviction with reason had nothing all attempts logical inquiry resulted indeed leaving more sceptical than before had been advised study cousin studied him his own works well those his european and american echoes the charles elwood brownson for example was placed hands read with profound attention throughout found logical but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments the disbelieving hero the book his summing seemed evident that the reasoner had not even succeeded convincing himself his end had plainly forgotten his beginning like the government trinculo short was not long perceiving that man intellectually convinced his own immortality will never convinced the mere abstractions which have been long the fashion the moralists england france and germany abstractions may amuse and exercise but take hold the mind here upon earth least philosophy persuaded will always vain call upon look upon qualities things the will may assent the soul the intellect never repeat then that only half felt and never intellectually believed but latterly there has been certain deepening the feeling until has come nearly resemble the acquiescence reason that find difficult distinguish between the two enabled too plainly trace this effect the mesmeric influence cannot better explain meaning than the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables perceive train ratiocination which abnormal existence convinces but which full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena does not extend except through its effect into normal condition sleep waking the reasoning and its conclusion the cause and its effect are present together natural state the cause vanishing the effect only and perhaps only partially remains these considerations have led think that some good results might ensue from series well directed questions propounded while mesmerized you have often observed the profound self cognizance evinced the sleep waker the extensive knowledge displays upon all points relating the mesmeric condition itself and from this self cognizance may deduced hints for the proper conduct catechism consented course make this experiment few passes threw vankirk into the mesmeric sleep his breathing became immediately more easy and seemed suffer physical uneasiness the following conversation then ensued the dialogue representing the patient and myself are you asleep yes would rather sleep more soundly after few more passes you sleep now yes how you think your present illness will result after long hesitation and speaking with effort must die does the idea death afflict you very quickly are you pleased with the prospect were awake should like die but now matter the mesmeric condition near death content wish you would explain yourself vankirk willing but requires more effort than feel able make you not question properly what then shall ask you must begin the beginning the beginning but where the beginning you know that the beginning god this was said low fluctuating tone and with every sign the most profound veneration what then god hesitating for many minutes cannot tell not god spirit while was awake knew what you meant spirit but now seems only word such for instance truth beauty quality mean not god immaterial there immateriality mere word that which not matter not all unless qualities are things god then material this reply startled very much what then after long pause and mutteringly see but thing difficult tell another long pause not spirit for exists nor matter you understand but there are gradations matter which man knows nothing the grosser impelling the finer the finer pervading the grosser the atmosphere for example impels the electric principle while the electric principle permeates the atmosphere these gradations matter increase rarity fineness until arrive matter unparticled without particles indivisible one and here the law impulsion and permeation modified the ultimate unparticled matter not only permeates all things but impels all things and thus all things within itself this matter god what men attempt embody the word thought this matter motion the metaphysicians maintain that all action reducible motion and thinking and that the latter the origin the former yes and now see the confusion idea motion the action mind not thinking the unparticled matter god quiescence nearly can conceive what men call mind and the power self movement equivalent effect human volition the unparticled matter the result its unity and omniprevalence how know not and now clearly see that shall never know but the unparticled matter set motion law quality existing within itself thinking can you give more precise idea what you term the unparticled matter the matters which man cognizant escape the senses gradation have for example metal piece wood drop water the atmosphere gas caloric electricity the luminiferous ether now call all these things matter and embrace all matter one general definition but spite this there can two ideas more essentially distinct than that which attach metal and that which attach the luminiferous ether when reach the latter feel almost irresistible inclination class with spirit with nihility the only consideration which restrains our conception its atomic constitution and here even have seek aid from our notion atom something possessing infinite minuteness solidity palpability weight destroy the idea the atomic constitution and should longer able regard the ether entity least matter for want better word might term spirit take now step beyond the luminiferous ether conceive matter much more rare than the ether this ether more rare than the metal and arrive once spite all the school dogmas unique mass unparticled matter for although may admit infinite littleness the atoms themselves the infinitude littleness the spaces between them absurdity there will point there will degree rarity which the atoms are sufficiently numerous the interspaces must vanish and the mass absolutely coalesce but the consideration the atomic constitution being now taken away the nature the mass inevitably glides into what conceive spirit clear however that fully matter before the truth impossible conceive spirit since impossible imagine what not when flatter ourselves that have formed its conception have merely deceived our understanding the consideration infinitely rarified matter there seems insurmountable objection the idea absolute coalescence and that the very slight resistance experienced the heavenly bodies their revolutions through space resistance now ascertained true exist some degree but which nevertheless slight have been quite overlooked the sagacity even newton know that the resistance bodies chiefly proportion their density absolute coalescence absolute density where there are interspaces there can yielding ether absolutely dense would put infinitely more effectual stop the progress star than would ether adamant iron your objection answered with ease which nearly the ratio its apparent unanswerability regards the progress the star can make difference whether the star passes through the ether the ether through there astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation the comets with the idea their passage through ether for however rare this ether supposed would put stop all sidereal revolution very far briefer period than has been admitted those astronomers who have endeavored slur over point which they found impossible comprehend the retardation actually experienced the other hand about that which might expected from the friction the ether the instantaneous passage through the orb the one case the retarding force momentary and complete within itself the other endlessly accumulative but all this this identification mere matter with god there nothing irreverence was forced repeat this question before the sleep waker fully comprehended meaning can you say why matter should less reverenced than mind but you forget that the matter which speak all respects the very mind spirit the schools far regards its high capacities and moreover the matter these schools the same time god with all the powers attributed spirit but the perfection matter you assert then that the unparticled matter motion thought general this motion the universal thought the universal mind this thought creates all created things are but the thoughts god you say general yes the universal mind god for new individualities matter necessary but you now speak mind and matter the metaphysicians yes avoid confusion when say mind mean the unparticled ultimate matter matter intend all else you were saying that for new individualities matter necessary yes for mind existing unincorporate merely god create individual thinking beings was necessary incarnate portions the divine mind thus man individualized divested corporate investiture were god now the particular motion the incarnated portions the unparticled matter the thought man the motion the whole that god you say that divested the body man will god after much hesitation could not have said this absurdity referring notes you did say that divested corporate investiture man were god and this true man thus divested would god would unindividualized but can never thus divested least never will else must imagine action god returning upon itself purposeless and futile action man creature creatures are thoughts god the nature thought irrevocable not comprehend you say that man will never put off the body say that will never bodiless explain there are two bodies the rudimental and the complete corresponding with the two conditions the worm and the butterfly what call death but the painful metamorphosis our present incarnation progressive preparatory temporary our future perfected ultimate immortal the ultimate life the full design but the worm metamorphosis are palpably cognizant certainly but not the worm the matter which our rudimental body composed within the ken the organs that body more distinctly our rudimental organs are adapted the matter which formed the rudimental body but not that which the ultimate composed the ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses and perceive only the shell which falls decaying from the inner form not that inner form itself but this inner form well the shell appreciable those who have already acquired the ultimate life you have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles death how this when say that resembles death mean that resembles the ultimate life for when entranced the senses rudimental life are abeyance and perceive external things directly without organs through medium which shall employ the ultimate unorganized life unorganized yes organs are contrivances which the individual brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms matter the exclusion other classes and forms the organs man are adapted his rudimental condition and that only his ultimate condition being unorganized unlimited comprehension all points but one the nature the volition god that say the motion the unparticled matter you will have distinct idea the ultimate body conceiving entire brain this not but conception this nature will bring you near comprehension what luminous body imparts vibration the luminiferous ether the vibrations generate similar ones within the retina these again communicate similar ones the optic nerve the nerve conveys similar ones the brain the brain also similar ones the unparticled matter which permeates the motion this latter thought which perception the first undulation this the mode which the mind the rudimental life communicates with the external world and this external world the rudimental life limited through the idiosyncrasy its organs but the ultimate unorganized life the external world reaches the whole body which substance having affinity brain have said with other intervention than that infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous and this ether unison with the whole body vibrates setting motion the unparticled matter which permeates the absence idiosyncratic organs therefore that must attribute the nearly unlimited perception the ultimate life rudimental beings organs are the cages necessary confine them until fledged you speak rudimental beings are there other rudimental thinking beings than man the multitudinous conglomeration rare matter into nebul planets suns and other bodies which are neither nebul suns nor planets for the sole purpose supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy the organs infinity rudimental beings but for the necessity the rudimental prior the ultimate life there would have been bodies such these each these tenanted distinct variety organic rudimental thinking creatures all the organs vary with the features the place tenanted death metamorphosis these creatures enjoying the ultimate life immortality and cognizant all secrets but the one act all things and pass everywhere mere volition indwelling not the stars which seem the sole palpabilities and for the accommodation which blindly deem space created but that space itself that infinity which the truly substantive vastness swallows the star shadows blotting them out non entities from the perception the angels you say that but for the necessity the rudimental life there would have been stars but why this necessity the inorganic life well the inorganic matter generally there nothing impede the action one simple unique law the divine volition with the view producing impediment the organic life and matter complex substantial and law encumbered were contrived but again why need this impediment have been produced the result law inviolate perfection right negative happiness the result law violate imperfection wrong positive pain through the impediments afforded the number complexity and substantiality the laws organic life and matter the violation law rendered certain extent practicable thus pain which the inorganic life impossible possible the organic but what good end pain thus rendered possible all things are either good bad comparison sufficient analysis will show that pleasure all cases but the contrast pain positive pleasure mere idea happy any one point must have suffered the same never suffer would have been never have been blessed but has been shown that the inorganic life pain cannot thus the necessity for the organic the pain the primitive life earth the sole basis the bliss the ultimate life heaven still there one your expressions which find impossible comprehend the truly substantive vastness infinity this probably because you have sufficiently generic conception the term substance itself must not regard quality but sentiment the perception thinking beings the adaptation matter their organization there are many things the earth which would nihility the inhabitants venus many things visible and tangible venus which could not brought appreciate existing all but the inorganic beings the angels the whole the unparticled matter substance that say the whole what term space them the truest substantiality the stars meantime through what consider their materiality escaping the angelic sense just proportion the unparticled matter through what consider its immateriality eludes the organic the sleep waker pronounced these latter words feeble tone observed his countenance singular expression which somewhat alarmed and induced awake him once sooner had done this than with bright smile irradiating all his features fell back upon his pillow and expired noticed that less than minute afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity stone his brow was the coldness ice thus ordinarily should have appeared only after long pressure from azrael hand had the sleep waker indeed during the latter portion his discourse been addressing from out the region the shadows
