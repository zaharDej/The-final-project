silence fable the mountain pinnacles slumber valleys crags and caves are silent listen said the demon placed his hand upon head the region which speak dreary region libya the borders the river zaire and there quiet there nor silence the waters the river have saffron and sickly hue and they flow not onwards the sea but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye the sun with tumultuous and convulsive motion for many miles either side the river oozy bed pale desert gigantic water lilies they sigh one unto the other that solitude and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks and nod and fro their everlasting heads and there indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing subterrene water and they sigh one unto the other but there boundary their realm the boundary the dark horrible lofty forest there like the waves about the hebrides the low underwood agitated continually but there wind throughout the heaven and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with crashing and mighty sound and from their high summits one one drop everlasting dews and the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing perturbed slumber and overhead with rustling and loud noise the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll cataract over the fiery wall the horizon but there wind throughout the heaven and the shores the river zaire there neither quiet nor silence was night and the rain fell and falling was rain but having fallen was blood and stood the morass among the tall and the rain fell upon head and the lilies sighed one unto the other the solemnity their desolation and all once the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist and was crimson color and mine eyes fell upon huge gray rock which stood the shore the river and was lighted the light the moon and the rock was gray and ghastly and tall and the rock was gray upon its front were characters engraven the stone and walked through the morass water lilies until came close unto the shore that might read the characters upon the stone but could not decypher them and was going back into the morass when the moon shone with fuller red and turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the characters and the characters were desolation and looked upwards and there stood man upon the summit the rock and hid myself among the water lilies that might discover the actions the man and the man was tall and stately form and was wrapped from his shoulders his feet the toga old rome and the outlines his figure were indistinct but his features were the features deity for the mantle the night and the mist and the moon and the dew had left uncovered the features his face and his brow was lofty with thought and his eye wild with care and the few furrows upon his cheek read the fables sorrow and weariness and disgust with mankind and longing after solitude and the man sat upon the rock and leaned his head upon his hand and looked out upon the desolation looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery and into the tall primeval trees and higher the rustling heaven and into the crimson moon and lay close within shelter the lilies and observed the actions the man and the man trembled the solitude but the night waned and sat upon the rock and the man turned his attention from the heaven and looked out upon the dreary river zaire and upon the yellow ghastly waters and upon the pale legions the water lilies and the man listened the sighs the water lilies and the murmur that came from among them and lay close within covert and observed the actions the man and the man trembled the solitude but the night waned and sat upon the rock then went down into the recesses the morass and waded afar among the wilderness the lilies and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens the recesses the morass and the hippopotami heard call and came with the behemoth unto the foot the rock and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon and lay close within covert and observed the actions the man and the man trembled the solitude but the night waned and sat upon the rock then cursed the elements with the curse tumult and frightful tempest gathered the heaven where before there had been wind and the heaven became livid with the violence the tempest and the rain beat upon the head the man and the floods the river came down and the river was tormented into foam and the water lilies shrieked within their beds and the forest crumbled before the wind and the thunder rolled and the lightning fell and the rock rocked its foundation and lay close within covert and observed the actions the man and the man trembled the solitude but the night waned and sat upon the rock then grew angry and cursed with the curse silence the river and the lilies and the wind and the forest and the heaven and the thunder and the sighs the water lilies and they became accursed and were still and the moon ceased totter its pathway heaven and the thunder died away and the lightning did not flash and the clouds hung motionless and the waters sunk their level and remained and the trees ceased rock and the water lilies sighed more and the murmur was heard longer from among them nor any shadow sound throughout the vast illimitable desert and looked upon the characters the rock and they were changed and the characters were silence and mine eyes fell upon the countenance the man and his countenance was wan with terror and hurriedly raised his head from his hand and stood forth upon the rock and listened but there was voice throughout the vast illimitable desert and the characters upon the rock were silence and the man shuddered and turned his face away and fled afar off haste that beheld him more now there are fine tales the volumes the magi the iron bound melancholy volumes the magi therein say are glorious histories the heaven and the earth and the mighty sea and the genii that over ruled the sea and the earth and the lofty heaven there was much lore too the sayings which were said the sybils and holy holy things were heard old the dim leaves that trembled around dodona but allah liveth that fable which the demon told sat side the shadow the tomb hold the most wonderful all and the demon made end his story fell back within the cavity the tomb and laughed and could not laugh with the demon and cursed because could not laugh and the lynx which dwelleth forever the tomb came out therefrom and lay down the feet the demon and looked him steadily the face
