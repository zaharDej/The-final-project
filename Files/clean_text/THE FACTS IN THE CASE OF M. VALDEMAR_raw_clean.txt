the facts the case valdemar course shall not pretend consider any matter for wonder that the extraordinary case valdemar has excited discussion would have been miracle had not especially under the circumstances through the desire all parties concerned keep the affair from the public least for the present until had farther opportunities for investigation through our endeavors effect this garbled exaggerated account made its way into society and became the source many unpleasant misrepresentations and very naturally great deal disbelief now rendered necessary that give the facts far comprehend them myself they are succinctly these attention for the last three years had been repeatedly drawn the subject mesmerism and about nine months ago occurred quite suddenly that the series experiments made hitherto there had been very remarkable and most unaccountable omission person had yet been mesmerized articulo mortis remained seen first whether such condition there existed the patient any susceptibility the magnetic influence secondly whether any existed was impaired increased the condition thirdly what extent for how long period the encroachments death might arrested the process there were other points ascertained but these most excited curiosity the last especial from the immensely important character its consequences looking around for some subject whose means might test these particulars was brought think friend ernest valdemar the well known compiler the bibliotheca forensica and author under the nom plume issachar marx the polish versions wallenstein and gargantua valdemar who has resided principally harlem since the year was particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness his person his lower limbs much resembling those john randolph and also for the whiteness his whiskers violent contrast the blackness his hair the latter consequence being very generally mistaken for wig his temperament was markedly nervous and rendered him good subject for mesmeric experiment two three occasions had put him sleep with little difficulty but was disappointed other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led anticipate his will was period positively thoroughly under control and regard clairvoyance could accomplish with him nothing relied upon always attributed failure these points the disordered state his health for some months previous becoming acquainted with him his physicians had declared him confirmed phthisis was his custom indeed speak calmly his approaching dissolution matter neither avoided nor regretted when the ideas which have alluded first occurred was course very natural that should think valdemar knew the steady philosophy the man too well apprehend any scruples from him and had relatives america who would likely interfere spoke him frankly upon the subject and surprise his interest seemed vividly excited say surprise for although had always yielded his person freely experiments had never before given any tokens sympathy with what did his disease was that character which would admit exact calculation respect the epoch its termination death and was finally arranged between that would send for about twenty four hours before the period announced his physicians that his decease now rather more than seven months since received from valdemar himself the subjoined note dear you may well come now and are agreed that cannot hold out beyond morrow midnight and think they have hit the time very nearly valdemar received this note within half hour after was written and fifteen minutes more was the dying man chamber had not seen him for ten days and was appalled the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought him his face wore leaden hue the eyes were utterly lustreless and the emaciation was extreme that the skin had been broken through the cheek bones his expectoration was excessive the pulse was barely perceptible retained nevertheless very remarkable manner both his mental power and certain degree physical strength spoke with distinctness took some palliative medicines without aid and when entered the room was occupied penciling memoranda pocket book was propped the bed pillows doctors and were attendance after pressing valdemar hand took these gentlemen aside and obtained from them minute account the patient condition the left lung had been for eighteen months semi osseous cartilaginous state and was course entirely useless for all purposes vitality the right its upper portion was also partially not thoroughly ossified while the lower region was merely mass purulent tubercles running one into another several extensive perforations existed and one point permanent adhesion the ribs had taken place these appearances the right lobe were comparatively recent date the ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity sign had been discovered month before and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days independently the phthisis the patient was suspected aneurism the aorta but this point the osseous symptoms rendered exact diagnosis impossible was the opinion both physicians that valdemar would die about midnight the morrow sunday was then seven clock saturday evening quitting the invalid bed side hold conversation with myself doctors and had bidden him final farewell had not been their intention return but request they agreed look upon the patient about ten the next night when they had gone spoke freely with valdemar the subject his approaching dissolution well more particularly the experiment proposed still professed himself quite willing and even anxious have made and urged commence once male and female nurse were attendance but did not feel myself altogether liberty engage task this character with more reliable witnesses than these people case sudden accident might prove therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night when the arrival medical student with whom had some acquaintance theodore relieved from farther embarrassment had been design originally wait for the physicians but was induced proceed first the urgent entreaties valdemar and secondly conviction that had not moment lose was evidently sinking fast was kind accede desire that would take notes all that occurred and from his memoranda that what now have relate for the most part either condensed copied verbatim wanted about five minutes eight when taking the patient hand begged him state distinctly could whether valdemar was entirely willing that should make the experiment mesmerizing him his then condition replied feebly yet quite audibly yes wish fear you have mesmerized adding immediately afterwards fear you have deferred too long while spoke thus commenced the passes which had already found most effectual subduing him was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke hand across his forehead but although exerted all powers further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten clock when doctors and called according appointment explained them few words what designed and they opposed objection saying that the patient was already the death agony proceeded without hesitation exchanging however the lateral passes for downward ones and directing gaze entirely into the right eye the sufferer this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous and intervals half minute this condition was nearly unaltered for quarter hour the expiration this period however natural although very deep sigh escaped the bosom the dying man and the stertorous breathing ceased that say its stertorousness was longer apparent the intervals were undiminished the patient extremities were icy coldness five minutes before eleven perceived unequivocal signs the mesmeric influence the glassy roll the eye was changed for that expression uneasy inward examination which never seen except cases sleep waking and which quite impossible mistake with few rapid lateral passes made the lids quiver incipient sleep and with few more closed them altogether was not satisfied however with this but continued the manipulations vigorously and with the fullest exertion the will until had completely stiffened the limbs the slumberer after placing them seemingly easy position the legs were full length the arms were nearly and reposed the bed moderate distance from the loin the head was very slightly elevated when had accomplished this was fully midnight and requested the gentlemen present examine valdemar condition after few experiments they admitted him unusually perfect state mesmeric trance the curiosity both the physicians was greatly excited resolved once remain with the patient all night while took leave with promise return daybreak and the nurses remained left valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three clock the morning when approached him and found him precisely the same condition when went away that say lay the same position the pulse was imperceptible the breathing was gentle scarcely noticeable unless through the application mirror the lips the eyes were closed naturally and the limbs were rigid and cold marble still the general appearance was certainly not that death approached valdemar made kind half effort influence his right arm into pursuit own passed the latter gently and fro above his person such experiments with this patient had never perfectly succeeded before and assuredly had little thought succeeding now but astonishment his arm very readily although feebly followed every direction assigned with mine determined hazard few words conversation valdemar said are you asleep made answer but perceived tremor about the lips and was thus induced repeat the question again and again its third repetition his whole frame was agitated very slight shivering the eyelids unclosed themselves far display white line the ball the lips moved sluggishly and from between them barely audible whisper issued the words yes asleep now not wake let die here felt the limbs and found them rigid ever the right arm before obeyed the direction hand questioned the sleep waker again you still feel pain the breast valdemar the answer now was immediate but even less audible than before pain dying did not think advisable disturb him farther just then and nothing more was said done until the arrival who came little before sunrise and expressed unbounded astonishment finding the patient still alive after feeling the pulse and applying mirror the lips requested speak the sleep waker again did saying valdemar you still sleep before some minutes elapsed ere reply was made and during the interval the dying man seemed collecting his energies speak fourth repetition the question said very faintly almost inaudibly yes still asleep dying was now the opinion rather the wish the physicians that valdemar should suffered remain undisturbed his present apparently tranquil condition until death should supervene and this was generally agreed must now take place within few minutes concluded however speak him once more and merely repeated previous question while spoke there came marked change over the countenance the sleep waker the eyes rolled themselves slowly open the pupils disappearing upwardly the skin generally assumed cadaverous hue resembling not much parchment white paper and the circular hectic spots which hitherto had been strongly defined the centre each cheek went out once use this expression because the suddenness their departure put mind nothing much the extinguishment candle puff the breath the upper lip the same time writhed itself away from the teeth which had previously covered completely while the lower jaw fell with audible jerk leaving the mouth widely extended and disclosing full view the swollen and blackened tongue presume that member the party then present had been unaccustomed death bed horrors but hideous beyond conception was the appearance valdemar this moment that there was general shrinking back from the region the bed now feel that have reached point this narrative which every reader will startled into positive disbelief business however simply proceed there was longer the faintest sign vitality valdemar and concluding him dead were consigning him the charge the nurses when strong vibratory motion was observable the tongue this continued for perhaps minute the expiration this period there issued from the distended and motionless jaws voice such would madness attempt describing there are indeed two three epithets which might considered applicable part might say for example that the sound was harsh and broken and hollow but the hideous whole indescribable for the simple reason that similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear humanity there were two particulars nevertheless which thought then and still think might fairly stated characteristic the intonation well adapted convey some idea its unearthly peculiarity the first place the voice seemed reach our ears least mine from vast distance from some deep cavern within the earth the second place impressed fear indeed that will impossible make myself comprehended gelatinous glutinous matters impress the sense touch have spoken both sound and voice mean say that the sound was one distinct even wonderfully thrillingly distinct syllabification valdemar spoke obviously reply the question had propounded him few minutes before had asked him will remembered still slept now said yes have been sleeping and now now dead person present even affected deny attempted repress the unutterable shuddering horror which these few words thus uttered were well calculated convey the student swooned the nurses immediately left the chamber and could not induced return own impressions would not pretend render intelligible the reader for nearly hour busied ourselves silently without the utterance word endeavors revive when came himself addressed ourselves again investigation valdemar condition remained all respects have last described with the exception that the mirror longer afforded evidence respiration attempt draw blood from the arm failed should mention too that this limb was farther subject will endeavored vain make follow the direction hand the only real indication indeed the mesmeric influence was now found the vibratory movement the tongue whenever addressed valdemar question seemed making effort reply but had longer sufficient volition queries put him any other person than myself seemed utterly insensible although endeavored place each member the company mesmeric rapport with him believe that have now related all that necessary understanding the sleep waker state this epoch other nurses were procured and ten clock left the house company with the two physicians and the afternoon all called again see the patient his condition remained precisely the same had now some discussion the propriety and feasibility awakening him but had little difficulty agreeing that good purpose would served doing was evident that far death what usually termed death had been arrested the mesmeric process seemed clear all that awaken valdemar would merely insure his instant least his speedy dissolution from this period until the close last week interval nearly seven months continued make daily calls valdemar house accompanied now and then medical and other friends all this time the sleeper waker remained exactly have last described him the nurses attentions were continual was friday last that finally resolved make the experiment awakening attempting awaken him and the perhaps unfortunate result this latter experiment which has given rise much discussion private circles much what cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling for the purpose relieving valdemar from the mesmeric trance made use the customary passes these for time were unsuccessful the first indication revival was afforded partial descent the iris was observed especially remarkable that this lowering the pupil was accompanied the profuse out flowing yellowish ichor from beneath the lids pungent and highly offensive odor was now suggested that should attempt influence the patient arm heretofore made the attempt and failed then intimated desire have put question did follows valdemar can you explain what are your feelings wishes now there was instant return the hectic circles the cheeks the tongue quivered rather rolled violently the mouth although the jaws and lips remained rigid before and length the same hideous voice which have already described broke forth for god sake quick quick put sleep quick waken quick say you that dead was thoroughly unnerved and for instant remained undecided what first made endeavor recompose the patient but failing this through total abeyance the will retraced steps and earnestly struggled awaken him this attempt soon saw that should successful least soon fancied that success would complete and sure that all the room were prepared see the patient awaken for what really occurred however quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared rapidly made the mesmeric passes amid ejaculations dead dead absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips the sufferer his whole frame once within the space single minute even less shrunk crumbled absolutely rotted away beneath hands upon the bed before that whole company there lay nearly liquid mass loathsome detestable putrescence
