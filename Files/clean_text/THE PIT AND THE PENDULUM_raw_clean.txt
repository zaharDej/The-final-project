the pit and the pendulum impia tortorum longos hic turba furores sanguinis innocui non satiata aluit sospite nunc patria fracto nunc funeris antro mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent quatrain composed for the gates market erected upon the site the jacobin club house paris was sick sick unto death with that long agony and when they length unbound and was permitted sit felt that senses were leaving the sentence the dread sentence death was the last distinct accentuation which reached ears after that the sound the inquisitorial voices seemed merged one dreamy indeterminate hum conveyed soul the idea revolution perhaps from its association fancy with the burr mill wheel this only for brief period for presently heard more yet for while saw but with how terrible exaggeration saw the lips the black robed judges they appeared white whiter than the sheet upon which trace these words and thin even grotesqueness thin with the intensity their expression firmness immoveable resolution stern contempt human torture saw that the decrees what was fate were still issuing from those lips saw them writhe with deadly locution saw them fashion the syllables name and shuddered because sound succeeded saw too for few moments delirious horror the soft and nearly imperceptible waving the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls the apartment and then vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table first they wore the aspect charity and seemed white and slender angels who would save but then all once there came most deadly nausea over spirit and felt every fibre frame thrill had touched the wire galvanic battery while the angel forms became meaningless spectres with heads flame and saw that from them there would help and then there stole into fancy like rich musical note the thought what sweet rest there must the grave the thought came gently and stealthily and seemed long before attained full appreciation but just spirit came length properly feel and entertain the figures the judges vanished magically from before the tall candles sank into nothingness their flames went out utterly the blackness darkness supervened all sensations appeared swallowed mad rushing descent the soul into hades then silence and stillness night were the universe had swooned but still will not say that all consciousness was lost what there remained will not attempt define even describe yet all was not lost the deepest slumber delirium swoon death even the grave all not lost else there immortality for man arousing from the most profound slumbers break the gossamer web some dream yet second afterward frail may that web have been remember not that have dreamed the return life from the swoon there are two stages first that the sense mental spiritual secondly that the sense physical existence seems probable that upon reaching the second stage could recall the impressions the first should find these impressions eloquent memories the gulf beyond and that gulf what how least shall distinguish its shadows from those the tomb but the impressions what have termed the first stage are not will recalled yet after long interval they not come unbidden while marvel whence they come who has never swooned not who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces coals that glow not who beholds floating mid air the sad visions that the many may not view not who ponders over the perfume some novel flower not whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors remember amid earnest struggles regather some token the state seeming nothingness into which soul had lapsed there have been moments when have dreamed success there have been brief very brief periods when have conjured remembrances which the lucid reason later epoch assures could have had reference only that condition seeming unconsciousness these shadows memory tell indistinctly tall figures that lifted and bore silence down down still down till hideous dizziness oppressed the mere idea the interminableness the descent they tell also vague horror heart account that heart unnatural stillness then comes sense sudden motionlessness throughout all things those who bore ghastly train had outrun their descent the limits the limitless and paused from the wearisomeness their toil after this call mind flatness and dampness and then all madness the madness memory which busies itself among forbidden things very suddenly there came back soul motion and sound the tumultuous motion the heart and ears the sound its beating then pause which all blank then again sound and motion and touch tingling sensation pervading frame then the mere consciousness existence without thought condition which lasted long then very suddenly thought and shuddering terror and earnest endeavor comprehend true state then strong desire lapse into insensibility then rushing revival soul and successful effort move and now full memory the trial the judges the sable draperies the sentence the sickness the swoon then entire forgetfulness all that followed all that later day and much earnestness endeavor have enabled vaguely recall far had not opened eyes felt that lay upon back unbound reached out hand and fell heavily upon something damp and hard there suffered remain for many minutes while strove imagine where and what could longed yet dared not employ vision dreaded the first glance objects around was not that feared look upon things horrible but that grew aghast lest there should nothing see length with wild desperation heart quickly unclosed eyes worst thoughts then were confirmed the blackness eternal night encompassed struggled for breath the intensity the darkness seemed oppress and stifle the atmosphere was intolerably close still lay quietly and made effort exercise reason brought mind the inquisitorial proceedings and attempted from that point deduce real condition the sentence had passed and appeared that very long interval time had since elapsed yet not for moment did suppose myself actually dead such supposition notwithstanding what read fiction altogether inconsistent with real existence but where and what state was the condemned death knew perished usually the autos and one these had been held the very night the day trial had been remanded dungeon await the next sacrifice which would not take place for many months this once saw could not victims had been immediate demand moreover dungeon well all the condemned cells toledo had stone floors and light was not altogether excluded fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood torrents upon heart and for brief period once more relapsed into insensibility upon recovering once started feet trembling convulsively every fibre thrust arms wildly above and around all directions felt nothing yet dreaded move step lest should impeded the walls tomb perspiration burst from every pore and stood cold big beads upon forehead the agony suspense grew length intolerable and cautiously moved forward with arms extended and eyes straining from their sockets the hope catching some faint ray light proceeded for many paces but still all was blackness and vacancy breathed more freely seemed evident that mine was not least the most hideous fates and now still continued step cautiously onward there came thronging upon recollection thousand vague rumors the horrors toledo the dungeons there had been strange things narrated fables had always deemed them but yet strange and too ghastly repeat save whisper was left perish starvation this subterranean world darkness what fate perhaps even more fearful awaited that the result would death and death more than customary bitterness knew too well the character judges doubt the mode and the hour were all that occupied distracted outstretched hands length encountered some solid obstruction was wall seemingly stone masonry very smooth slimy and cold followed stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired this process however afforded means ascertaining the dimensions dungeon might make its circuit and return the point whence set out without being aware the fact perfectly uniform seemed the wall therefore sought the knife which had been pocket when led into the inquisitorial chamber but was gone clothes had been exchanged for wrapper coarse serge had thought forcing the blade some minute crevice the masonry identify point departure the difficulty nevertheless was but trivial although the disorder fancy seemed first insuperable tore part the hem from the robe and placed the fragment full length and right angles the wall groping way around the prison could not fail encounter this rag upon completing the circuit least thought but had not counted upon the extent the dungeon upon own weakness the ground was moist and slippery staggered onward for some time when stumbled and fell excessive fatigue induced remain prostrate and sleep soon overtook lay upon awaking and stretching forth arm found beside loaf and pitcher with water was too much exhausted reflect upon this circumstance but ate and drank with avidity shortly afterward resumed tour around the prison and with much toil came last upon the fragment the serge the period when fell had counted fifty two paces and upon resuming walk had counted forty eight more when arrived the rag there were all then hundred paces and admitting two paces the yard presumed the dungeon fifty yards circuit had met however with many angles the wall and thus could form guess the shape the vault for vault could not help supposing had little object certainly hope these researches but vague curiosity prompted continue them quitting the wall resolved cross the area the enclosure first proceeded with extreme caution for the floor although seemingly solid material was treacherous with slime length however took courage and did not hesitate step firmly endeavoring cross direct line possible had advanced some ten twelve paces this manner when the remnant the torn hem robe became entangled between legs stepped and fell violently face the confusion attending fall did not immediately apprehend somewhat startling circumstance which yet few seconds afterward and while still lay prostrate arrested attention was this chin rested upon the floor the prison but lips and the upper portion head although seemingly less elevation than the chin touched nothing the same time forehead seemed bathed clammy vapor and the peculiar smell decayed fungus arose nostrils put forward arm and shuddered find that had fallen the very brink circular pit whose extent course had means ascertaining the moment groping about the masonry just below the margin succeeded dislodging small fragment and let fall into the abyss for many seconds hearkened its reverberations dashed against the sides the chasm its descent length there was sullen plunge into water succeeded loud echoes the same moment there came sound resembling the quick opening and rapid closing door overhead while faint gleam light flashed suddenly through the gloom and suddenly faded away saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for and congratulated myself upon the timely accident which had escaped another step before fall and the world had seen more and the death just avoided was that very character which had regarded fabulous and frivolous the tales respecting the inquisition the victims its tyranny there was the choice death with its direst physical agonies death with its most hideous moral horrors had been reserved for the latter long suffering nerves had been unstrung until trembled the sound own voice and had become every respect fitting subject for the species torture which awaited shaking every limb groped way back the wall resolving there perish rather than risk the terrors the wells which imagination now pictured many various positions about the dungeon other conditions mind might have had courage end misery once plunge into one these abysses but now was the veriest cowards neither could forget what had read these pits that the sudden extinction life formed part their most horrible plan agitation spirit kept awake for many long hours but length again slumbered upon arousing found side before loaf and pitcher water burning thirst consumed and emptied the vessel draught must have been drugged for scarcely had drunk before became irresistibly drowsy deep sleep fell upon sleep like that death how long lasted course know not but when once again unclosed eyes the objects around were visible wild sulphurous lustre the origin which could not first determine was enabled see the extent and aspect the prison its size had been greatly mistaken the whole circuit its walls did not exceed twenty five yards for some minutes this fact occasioned world vain trouble vain indeed for what could less importance under the terrible circumstances which environed then the mere dimensions dungeon but soul took wild interest trifles and busied myself endeavors account for the error had committed measurement the truth length flashed upon first attempt exploration had counted fifty two paces the period when fell must then have been within pace two the fragment serge fact had nearly performed the circuit the vault then slept and upon awaking must have returned upon steps thus supposing the circuit nearly double what actually was confusion mind prevented from observing that began tour with the wall the left and ended with the wall the right had been deceived too respect the shape the enclosure feeling way had found many angles and thus deduced idea great irregularity potent the effect total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy sleep the angles were simply those few slight depressions niches odd intervals the general shape the prison was square what had taken for masonry seemed now iron some other metal huge plates whose sutures joints occasioned the depression the entire surface this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed all the hideous and repulsive devices which the charnel superstition the monks has given rise the figures fiends aspects menace with skeleton forms and other more really fearful images overspread and disfigured the walls observed that the outlines these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct but that the colors seemed faded and blurred from the effects damp atmosphere now noticed the floor too which was stone the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws had escaped but was the only one the dungeon all this saw indistinctly and much effort for personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber now lay upon back and full length species low framework wood this was securely bound long strap resembling surcingle passed many convolutions about limbs and body leaving liberty only head and left arm such extent that could dint much exertion supply myself with food from earthen dish which lay side the floor saw horror that the pitcher had been removed say horror for was consumed with intolerable thirst this thirst appeared the design persecutors stimulate for the food the dish was meat pungently seasoned looking upward surveyed the ceiling prison was some thirty forty feet overhead and constructed much the side walls one its panels very singular figure riveted whole attention was the painted figure time commonly represented save that lieu scythe held what casual glance supposed the pictured image huge pendulum such see antique clocks there was something however the appearance this machine which caused regard more attentively while gazed directly upward for its position was immediately over own fancied that saw motion instant afterward the fancy was confirmed its sweep was brief and course slow watched for some minutes somewhat fear but more wonder wearied length with observing its dull movement turned eyes upon the other objects the cell slight noise attracted notice and looking the floor saw several enormous rats traversing they had issued from the well which lay just within view right even then while gazed they came troops hurriedly with ravenous eyes allured the scent the meat from this required much effort and attention scare them away might have been half hour perhaps even hour for could take but imperfect note time before again cast eyes upward what then saw confounded and amazed the sweep the pendulum had increased extent nearly yard natural consequence its velocity was also much greater but what mainly disturbed was the idea that had perceptibly descended now observed with what horror needless say that its nether extremity was formed crescent glittering steel about foot length from horn horn the horns upward and the under edge evidently keen that razor like razor also seemed massy and heavy tapering from the edge into solid and broad structure above was appended weighty rod brass and the whole hissed swung through the air could longer doubt the doom prepared for monkish ingenuity torture cognizance the pit had become known the inquisitorial agents the pit whose horrors had been destined for bold recusant myself the pit typical hell and regarded rumor the ultima thule all their punishments the plunge into this pit had avoided the merest accidents knew that surprise entrapment into torment formed important portion all the grotesquerie these dungeon deaths having failed fall was part the demon plan hurl into the abyss and thus there being alternative different and milder destruction awaited milder half smiled agony thought such application such term what boots tell the long long hours horror more than mortal during which counted the rushing vibrations the steel inch inch line line with descent only appreciable intervals that seemed ages down and still down came days passed might have been that many days passed ere swept closely over fan with its acrid breath the odor the sharp steel forced itself into nostrils prayed wearied heaven with prayer for its more speedy descent grew frantically mad and struggled force myself upward against the sweep the fearful scimitar and then fell suddenly calm and lay smiling the glittering death child some rare bauble there was another interval utter insensibility was brief for upon again lapsing into life there had been perceptible descent the pendulum but might have been long for knew there were demons who took note swoon and who could have arrested the vibration pleasure upon recovery too felt very inexpressibly sick and weak through long inanition even amid the agonies that period the human nature craved food with painful effort outstretched left arm far bonds permitted and took possession the small remnant which had been spared the rats put portion within lips there rushed mind half formed thought joy hope yet what business had with hope was say half formed thought man has many such which are never completed felt that was joy hope but felt also that had perished its formation vain struggled perfect regain long suffering had nearly annihilated all ordinary powers mind was imbecile idiot the vibration the pendulum was right angles length saw that the crescent was designed cross the region the heart would fray the serge robe would return and repeat its operations again and again notwithstanding its terrifically wide sweep some thirty feet more and the hissing vigor its descent sufficient sunder these very walls iron still the fraying robe would all that for several minutes would accomplish and this thought paused dared not farther than this reflection dwelt upon with pertinacity attention dwelling could arrest here the descent the steel forced myself ponder upon the sound the crescent should pass across the garment upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction cloth produces the nerves pondered upon all this frivolity until teeth were edge down steadily down crept took frenzied pleasure contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity the right the left far and wide with the shriek damned spirit heart with the stealthy pace the tiger alternately laughed and howled the one the other idea grew predominant down certainly relentlessly down vibrated within three inches bosom struggled violently furiously free left arm this was free only from the elbow the hand could reach the latter from the platter beside mouth with great effort but farther could have broken the fastenings above the elbow would have seized and attempted arrest the pendulum might well have attempted arrest avalanche down still unceasingly still inevitably down gasped and struggled each vibration shrunk convulsively its every sweep eyes followed its outward upward whirls with the eagerness the most unmeaning despair they closed themselves spasmodically the descent although death would have been relief how unspeakable still quivered every nerve think how slight sinking the machinery would precipitate that keen glistening axe upon bosom was hope that prompted the nerve quiver the frame shrink was hope the hope that triumphs the rack that whispers the death condemned even the dungeons the inquisition saw that some ten twelve vibrations would bring the steel actual contact with robe and with this observation there suddenly came over spirit all the keen collected calmness despair for the first time during many hours perhaps days thought now occurred that the bandage surcingle which enveloped was unique was tied separate cord the first stroke the razorlike crescent athwart any portion the band would detach that might unwound from person means left hand but how fearful that case the proximity the steel the result the slightest struggle how deadly was likely moreover that the minions the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility was probable that the bandage crossed bosom the track the pendulum dreading find faint and seemed last hope frustrated far elevated head obtain distinct view breast the surcingle enveloped limbs and body close all directions save the path the destroying crescent scarcely had dropped head back into its original position when there flashed upon mind what cannot better describe than the unformed half that idea deliverance which have previously alluded and which moiety only floated indeterminately through brain when raised food burning lips the whole thought was now present feeble scarcely sane scarcely definite but still entire proceeded once with the nervous energy despair attempt its execution for many hours the immediate vicinity the low framework upon which lay had been literally swarming with rats they were wild bold ravenous their red eyes glaring upon they waited but for motionlessness part make their prey what food thought have they been accustomed the well they had devoured spite all efforts prevent them all but small remnant the contents the dish had fallen into habitual see saw wave the hand about the platter and length the unconscious uniformity the movement deprived effect their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs fingers with the particles the oily and spicy viand which now remained thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever could reach then raising hand from the floor lay breathlessly still first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified the change the cessation movement they shrank alarmedly back many sought the well but this was only for moment had not counted vain upon their voracity observing that remained without motion one two the boldest leaped upon the frame work and smelt the surcingle this seemed the signal for general rush forth from the well they hurried fresh troops they clung the wood they overran and leaped hundreds upon person the measured movement the pendulum disturbed them not all avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage they pressed they swarmed upon ever accumulating heaps they writhed upon throat their cold lips sought own was half stifled their thronging pressure disgust for which the world has name swelled bosom and chilled with heavy clamminess heart yet one minute and felt that the struggle would over plainly perceived the loosening the bandage knew that more than one place must already severed with more than human resolution lay still nor had erred calculations nor had endured vain length felt that was free the surcingle hung ribands from body but the stroke the pendulum already pressed upon bosom had divided the serge the robe had cut through the linen beneath twice again swung and sharp sense pain shot through every nerve but the moment escape had arrived wave hand deliverers hurried tumultuously away with steady movement cautious sidelong shrinking and slow slid from the embrace the bandage and beyond the reach the scimitar for the moment least was free free and the grasp the inquisition had scarcely stepped from wooden bed horror upon the stone floor the prison when the motion the hellish machine ceased and beheld drawn some invisible force through the ceiling this was lesson which took desperately heart every motion was undoubtedly watched free had but escaped death one form agony delivered unto worse than death some other with that thought rolled eves nervously around the barriers iron that hemmed something unusual some change which first could not appreciate distinctly was obvious had taken place the apartment for many minutes dreamy and trembling abstraction busied myself vain unconnected conjecture during this period became aware for the first time the origin the sulphurous light which illumined the cell proceeded from fissure about half inch width extending entirely around the prison the base the walls which thus appeared and were completely separated from the floor endeavored but course vain look through the aperture arose from the attempt the mystery the alteration the chamber broke once upon understanding have observed that although the outlines the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite these colors had now assumed and were momentarily assuming startling and most intense brilliancy that gave the spectral and fiendish portraitures aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than own demon eyes wild and ghastly vivacity glared upon thousand directions where none had been visible before and gleamed with the lurid lustre fire that could not force imagination regard unreal unreal even while breathed there came nostrils the breath the vapour heated iron suffocating odour pervaded the prison deeper glow settled each moment the eyes that glared agonies richer tint crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors blood panted gasped for breath there could doubt the design tormentors most unrelenting most demoniac men shrank from the glowing metal the centre the cell amid the thought the fiery destruction that impended the idea the coolness the well came over soul like balm rushed its deadly brink threw straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for wild moment did spirit refuse comprehend the meaning what saw length forced wrestled its way into soul burned itself upon shuddering reason for voice speak horror any horror but this with shriek rushed from the margin and buried face hands weeping bitterly the heat rapidly increased and once again looked shuddering with fit the ague there had been second change the cell and now the change was obviously the form before was vain that first endeavoured appreciate understand what was taking place but not long was left doubt the inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried two fold escape and there was more dallying with the king terrors the room had been square saw that two its iron angles were now acute two consequently obtuse the fearful difference quickly increased with low rumbling moaning sound instant the apartment had shifted its form into that lozenge but the alteration stopped not here neither hoped nor desired stop could have clasped the red walls bosom garment eternal peace death said any death but that the pit fool might have not known that into the pit was the object the burning iron urge could resist its glow even that could withstand its pressure and now flatter and flatter grew the lozenge with rapidity that left time for contemplation its centre and course its greatest width came just over the yawning gulf shrank back but the closing walls pressed resistlessly onward length for seared and writhing body there was longer inch foothold the firm floor the prison struggled more but the agony soul found vent one loud long and final scream despair felt that tottered upon the brink averted eyes there was discordant hum human voices there was loud blast many trumpets there was harsh grating thousand thunders the fiery walls rushed back outstretched arm caught own fell fainting into the abyss was that general lasalle the french army had entered toledo the inquisition was the hands its enemies
