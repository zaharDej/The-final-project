the masque the red death the red death had long devastated the country pestilence had ever been fatal hideous blood was its avatar and its seal the redness and the horror blood there were sharp pains and sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding the pores with dissolution the scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy his fellow men and the whole seizure progress and termination the disease were the incidents half hour but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when his dominions were half depopulated summoned his presence thousand hale and light hearted friends from among the knights and dames his court and with these retired the deep seclusion one his castellated abbeys this was extensive and magnificent structure the creation the prince own eccentric yet august taste strong and lofty wall girdled this wall had gates iron the courtiers having entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts they resolved leave means neither ingress egress the sudden impulses despair frenzy from within the abbey was amply provisioned with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance contagion the external world could take care itself the meantime was folly grieve think the prince had provided all the appliances pleasure there were buffoons there were improvisatori there were ballet dancers there were musicians there was beauty there was wine all these and security were within without was the red death was toward the close the fifth sixth month his seclusion and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends masked ball the most unusual magnificence was voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let tell the rooms which was held there were seven imperial suite many palaces however such suites form long and straight vista while the folding doors slide back nearly the walls either hand that the view the whole extent scarcely impeded here the case was very different might have been expected from the duke love the bizarre the apartments were irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one time there was sharp turn every twenty thirty yards and each turn novel effect the right and left the middle each wall tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon closed corridor which pursued the windings the suite these windows were stained glass whose color varied accordance with the prevailing hue the decorations the chamber into which opened that the eastern extremity was hung for example blue and vividly blue were its windows the second chamber was purple its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes were purple the third was green throughout and were the casements the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange the fifth with white the sixth with violet the seventh apartment was closely shrouded black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls falling heavy folds upon carpet the same material and hue but this chamber only the color the windows failed correspond with the decorations the panes here were scarlet deep blood color now one the seven apartments was there any lamp candelabrum amid the profusion golden ornaments that lay scattered and fro depended from the roof there was light any kind emanating from lamp candle within the suite chambers but the corridors that followed the suite there stood opposite each window heavy tripod bearing brazier fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and glaringly illumined the room and thus were produced multitude gaudy and fantastic appearances but the western black chamber the effect the fire light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood tinted panes was ghastly the extreme and produced wild look upon the countenances those who entered that there were few the company bold enough set foot within its precincts all was this apartment also that there stood against the western wall gigantic clock ebony its pendulum swung and fro with dull heavy monotonous clang and when the minute hand made the circuit the face and the hour was stricken there came from the brazen lungs the clock sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical but peculiar note and emphasis that each lapse hour the musicians the orchestra were constrained pause momentarily their performance hearken the sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was brief disconcert the whole gay company and while the chimes the clock yet rang was observed that the giddiest grew pale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows confused reverie meditation but when the echoes had fully ceased light laughter once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked each other and smiled their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each the other that the next chiming the clock should produce them similar emotion and then after the lapse sixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds the time that flies there came yet another chiming the clock and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation before but spite these things was gay and magnificent revel the tastes the duke were peculiar had fine eye for colors and effects disregarded the decora mere fashion his plans were bold and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there are some who would have thought him mad his followers felt that was not was necessary hear and see and touch him sure that was not had directed great part the moveable embellishments the seven chambers upon occasion this great and was his own guiding taste which had given character the masqueraders sure they were grotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm much what has been since seen hernani there were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there were delirious fancies such the madman fashions there was much the beautiful much the wanton much the bizarre something the terrible and not little that which might have excited disgust and fro the seven chambers there stalked fact multitude dreams and these the dreams writhed and about taking hue from the rooms and causing the wild music the orchestra seem the echo their steps and anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands the hall the velvet and then for moment all still and all silent save the voice the clock the dreams are stiff frozen they stand but the echoes the chime die away they have endured but instant and light half subdued laughter floats after them they depart and now again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods but the chamber which lies most westwardly the seven there are now none the maskers who venture for the night waning away and there flows ruddier light through the blood colored panes and the blackness the sable drapery appals and him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near clock ebony muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge the more remote gaieties the other apartments but these other apartments were densely crowded and them beat feverishly the heart life and the revel went whirlingly until length there commenced the sounding midnight upon the clock and then the music ceased have told and the evolutions the waltzers were quieted and there was uneasy cessation all things before but now there were twelve strokes sounded the bell the clock and thus happened perhaps that more thought crept with more time into the meditations the thoughtful among those who revelled and thus too happened perhaps that before the last echoes the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many individuals the crowd who had found leisure become aware the presence masked figure which had arrested the attention single individual before and the rumor this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose length from the whole company buzz murmur expressive disapprobation and surprise then finally terror horror and disgust assembly phantasms such have painted may well supposed that ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation truth the masquerade license the night was nearly unlimited but the figure question had out heroded herod and gone beyond the bounds even the prince indefinite decorum there are chords the hearts the most reckless which cannot touched without emotion even with the utterly lost whom life and death are equally jests there are matters which jest can made the whole company indeed seemed now deeply feel that the costume and bearing the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the figure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head foot the habiliments the grave the mask which concealed the visage was made nearly resemble the countenance stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty detecting the cheat and yet all this might have been endured not approved the mad revellers around but the mummer had gone far assume the type the red death his vesture was dabbled blood and his broad brow with all the features the face was besprinkled with the scarlet horror when the eyes prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which with slow and solemn movement more fully sustain its role stalked and fro among the waltzers was seen convulsed the first moment with strong shudder either terror distaste but the next his brow reddened with rage who dares demanded hoarsely the courtiers who stood near him who dares insult with this blasphemous mockery seize him and unmask him that may know whom have hang sunrise from the battlements was the eastern blue chamber which stood the prince prospero uttered these words they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly for the prince was bold and robust man and the music had become hushed the waving his hand was the blue room where stood the prince with group pale courtiers his side first spoke there was slight rushing movement this group the direction the intruder who the moment was also near hand and now with deliberate and stately step made closer approach the speaker but from certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions the mummer had inspired the whole party there were found none who put forth hand seize him that unimpeded passed within yard the prince person and while the vast assembly with one impulse shrank from the centres the rooms the walls made his way uninterruptedly but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first through the blue chamber the purple through the purple the green through the green the orange through this again the white and even thence the violet ere decided movement had been made arrest him was then however that the prince prospero maddening with rage and the shame his own momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him account deadly terror that had seized upon all bore aloft drawn dagger and had approached rapid impetuosity within three four feet the retreating figure when the latter having attained the extremity the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer there was sharp cry and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterwards fell prostrate death the prince prospero then summoning the wild courage despair throng the revellers once threw themselves into the black apartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow the ebony clock gasped unutterable horror finding the grave cerements and corpse like mask which they handled with violent rudeness untenanted any tangible form and now was acknowledged the presence the red death had come like thief the night and one one dropped the revellers the blood bedewed halls their revel and died each the despairing posture his fall and the life the ebony clock went out with that the last the gay and the flames the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all
