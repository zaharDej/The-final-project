the fall the house usher son est luth suspendu sit touche sonne ranger during the whole dull dark and soundless day the autumn the year when the clouds hung oppressively low the heavens had been passing alone horseback through singularly dreary tract country and length found myself the shades the evening drew within view the melancholy house usher know not how was but with the first glimpse the building sense insufferable gloom pervaded spirit say insufferable for the feeling was unrelieved any that half pleasurable because poetic sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images the desolate terrible looked upon the scene before upon the mere house and the simple landscape features the domain upon the bleak walls upon the vacant eye like windows upon few rank sedges and upon few white trunks decayed trees with utter depression soul which can compare earthly sensation more properly than the after dream the reveller upon opium the bitter lapse into everyday life the hideous dropping off the veil there was iciness sinking sickening the heart unredeemed dreariness thought which goading the imagination could torture into aught the sublime what was paused think what was that unnerved the contemplation the house usher was mystery all insoluble nor could grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon pondered was forced fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are combinations very simple natural objects which have the power thus affecting still the analysis this power lies among considerations beyond our depth was possible reflected that mere different arrangement the particulars the scene the details the picture would sufficient modify perhaps annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea reined horse the precipitous brink black and lurid tarn that lay unruffled lustre the dwelling and gazed down but with shudder even more thrilling than before upon the remodelled

character the people and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one the long lapse centuries might have exercised upon the other was this deficiency perhaps collateral issue and the consequent undeviating transmission from sire son the patrimony with the name which had length identified the two merge the original title the estate the quaint and equivocal appellation the house

however the fabric gave little token instability perhaps the eye scrutinizing observer might have discovered barely perceptible fissure which extending from the roof the building front made its way

all upon entrance usher arose from sofa which had been lying full length and greeted with vivacious warmth which had much first thought overdone cordiality the constrained effort the ennuy man the world glance however his countenance convinced his perfect sincerity sat down and for some moments while spoke not gazed upon him with feeling half pity half awe surely man had never before terribly altered brief period had roderick usher was with difficulty that could bring myself admit the identity the wan being before with the companion early boyhood yet the character his face had been all

incoherence inconsistency and soon found this arise from series feeble and futile struggles overcome habitual trepidancy excessive nervous agitation for something this nature had indeed been prepared less his letter than reminiscences certain boyish traits and conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament his action was alternately vivacious and sullen his voice

his ordinary occupations were neglected forgotten roamed from chamber chamber with hurried unequal and objectless step the pallor his countenance had assumed possible more ghastly hue but the

within the donjon that experienced the full power such feelings sleep came not near couch while the hours waned and waned away struggled reason off the nervousness which had dominion over endeavored believe that much not all what felt was due the bewildering influence the gloomy furniture the room the dark and tattered draperies which tortured into motion the breath rising tempest swayed fitfully and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily about the decorations the bed but efforts were fruitless irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded frame and length there sat upon very heart incubus utterly causeless alarm shaking this off with gasp and struggle uplifted myself upon the pillows and peering earnestly within the intense darkness the chamber harkened know not why except that instinctive

clothes with haste for felt that should sleep more during the night and endeavored arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which had fallen pacing rapidly and fro through the apartment had

which had long endured and even welcomed his presence relief and you have not seen said abruptly after having stared about him for some moments silence you have not then seen but stay you shall thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp hurried one the casements and threw freely open the storm the impetuous fury the entering gust nearly lifted from our feet was indeed tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one wildly singular its terror and its beauty whirlwind had apparently collected its force our vicinity for there were frequent and violent alterations the direction the wind and the exceeding density the clouds which hung low press upon the turrets the house did not prevent our perceiving the life like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other without passing away into the distance say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this yet had glimpse the moon stars nor was there any flashing forth the lightning but the under surfaces the huge masses agitated vapor well all terrestrial objects immediately around were glowing the unnatural light faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion you must not you shall not behold this said shudderingly usher led him with gentle violence from the window seat these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon may that they have their ghastly origin the rank miasma the tarn let close this casement the air chilling and dangerous your frame here one your

with the hermit who sooth was obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his shoulders and fearing the rising the tempest uplifted his mace outright and with blows made quickly room the plankings the door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise the dry and hollow sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest the termination this sentence started and for moment paused for appeared although once concluded that excited fancy had deceived appeared that from some very remote portion the mansion there came indistinctly ears what might have been its exact similarity character the echo but stifled and dull one certainly the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had particularly described was beyond doubt the coincidence alone which had arrested attention for amid the rattling the sashes the casements and the ordinary commingled noises the still increasing storm the sound itself had nothing surely which should have interested disturbed continued the story but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore enraged and amazed perceive signal the maliceful hermit but the stead thereof dragon scaly and prodigious demeanor and fiery tongue which sate guard before palace gold with floor silver and upon the wall there hung shield shining brass with this legend enwritten who entereth herein conqueror hath bin who slayeth the dragon the shield shall win and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head the dragon which fell before him and gave his pesty breath with shriek horrid and harsh and withal piercing that ethelred had fain close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise the like whereof was never before heard here again paused abruptly and now with feeling wild amazement for there could doubt whatever that this instance did actually hear although from what direction proceeded found impossible say low and apparently distant but harsh protracted and most unusual screaming grating sound the exact counterpart what fancy had already conjured for the dragon unnatural shriek described the romancer oppressed

variance with this idea for rocked from side side with gentle yet constant and uniform sway having rapidly taken notice all this resumed the narrative sir launcelot which thus proceeded and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury the dragon bethinking himself the brazen shield and the breaking the enchantment which was upon removed the carcass from out the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement the castle where the shield was upon the wall which sooth tarried not for his full coming but fell down his feet upon the silver floor with mighty great and terrible ringing sound sooner had these syllables passed lips than shield brass had indeed the moment fallen heavily upon floor silver became aware distinct hollow metallic and clangorous yet apparently muffled reverberation completely unnerved leaped feet but the measured rocking movement usher was undisturbed rushed the chair which sat his eyes were bent fixedly before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned stony rigidity but placed hand upon his shoulder there came strong shudder over his whole person sickly smile quivered about his lips and saw that spoke low hurried
