imagination and fallen the flames thine own youth again fancy behold thee once more thy form hath risen before not not thou art the cold valley and shadow but thou shouldst squandering away life magnificent meditation that city dim visions thine own venice which star beloved elysium the sea and the wide windows whose palladian palaces look down with deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets her silent waters yes repeat thou shouldst there are surely other worlds than this other thoughts than the thoughts the multitude other speculations than the speculations the sophist who then shall call thy conduct into question who blame thee for thy visionary hours denounce those occupations wasting away life which were but the overflowings thine everlasting energies was venice beneath the covered archway there called the ponte sospiri that met for the third fourth time the person whom speak with confused recollection that bring mind the circumstances that meeting yet remember how should forget the deep midnight the bridge sighs the beauty woman and the genius romance that stalked and down the narrow canal was night unusual gloom the great clock the piazza had sounded the fifth hour the italian evening the square the campanile lay silent and deserted and the lights the old ducal palace were dying fast away was returning home from the piazetta way the grand canal but gondola arrived opposite the mouth the canal san marco female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night one wild hysterical and long continued shriek startled the sound sprang upon feet while the gondolier letting slip his single oar lost the pitchy darkness beyond chance recovery and were consequently left the guidance the current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel like some huge and sable feathered condor were slowly drifting down towards the bridge sighs when thousand flambeaux flashing from the windows and down the staircases the ducal palace turned all once that deep gloom into livid and preternatural day child slipping from the arms its own mother had fallen from upper window the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal the quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim and although own gondola was the only one sight many stout swimmer already the stream was seeking vain upon the surface the treasure which was found alas only within the abyss upon the broad black marble flagstones the entrance the palace and few steps above the water stood figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten was the marchesa aphrodite the adoration all venice the gayest the gay the most lovely where all were beautiful but still the young wife the old and intriguing mentoni and the mother that fair child her first and only one who now deep beneath the murky water was thinking bitterness heart upon her sweet caresses and exhausting its little life struggles call upon her name she stood alone her small bare and silvery feet gleamed the black mirror marble beneath her her hair not yet more than half loosened for the night from its ball room array clustered amid shower diamonds round and round her classical head curls like those the young hyacinth snowy white and gauze like drapery seemed nearly the sole covering her delicate form but the mid summer and midnight air was hot sullen and still and motion the statue like form itself stirred even the folds that raiment very vapor which hung around the heavy marble hangs around the niobe yet strange say her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried but riveted widely different direction the prison the old republic think the stateliest building all venice but how could that lady gaze fixedly upon when beneath her lay stifling her only child yon dark gloomy niche too yawns right opposite her chamber window what then could there its shadows its architecture its ivy wreathed and solemn cornices that the marchesa mentoni had not wondered thousand times before nonsense who does not remember that such time this the eye like shattered mirror multiplies the images its sorrow and sees innumerable far off places the woe which close hand many steps above the marchesa and within the arch the water gate stood full dress the satyr like figure mentoni himself was occasionally occupied thrumming guitar and seemed ennuye the very death intervals gave directions for the recovery his child stupefied and aghast had myself power move from the upright position had assumed upon first hearing the shriek and must have presented the eyes the agitated group spectral and ominous appearance with pale countenance and rigid limbs floated down among them that funereal gondola all efforts proved vain many the most energetic the search were relaxing their exertions and yielding gloomy sorrow there seemed but little hope for the child how much less than for the mother but now from the interior that dark niche which has been already mentioned forming part the old republican prison and fronting the lattice the marchesa figure muffled cloak stepped out within reach the light and pausing moment upon the verge the giddy descent plunged headlong into the canal instant afterwards stood with the still living and breathing child within his grasp upon the marble flagstones the side the marchesa his cloak heavy with the drenching water became unfastened and falling folds about his feet discovered the wonder stricken spectators the graceful person very young man with the sound whose name the greater part europe was then ringing word spoke the deliverer but the marchesa she will now receive her child she will press her heart she will cling its little form and smother with her caresses alas another arms have taken from the stranger another arms have taken away and borne afar off unnoticed into the palace and the marchesa her lip her beautiful lip trembles tears are gathering her eyes those eyes which like pliny acanthus are soft and almost liquid yes tears are gathering those eyes and see the entire woman thrills throughout the soul and the statue has started into life the pallor the marble countenance the swelling the marble bosom the very purity the marble feet behold suddenly flushed over with tide ungovernable crimson and slight shudder quivers about her delicate frame gentle air napoli about the rich silver lilies the grass why should that lady blush this demand there answer except that having left the eager haste and terror mother heart the privacy her own boudoir she has neglected enthral her tiny feet their slippers and utterly forgotten throw over her venetian shoulders that drapery which their due what other possible reason could there have been for her blushing for the glance those wild appealing eyes for the unusual tumult that throbbing bosom for the convulsive pressure that trembling hand that hand which fell mentoni turned into the palace accidentally upon the hand the stranger what reason could there have been for the low the singularly low tone those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly bidding him adieu thou hast conquered she said the murmurs the water deceived thou hast conquered one hour after sunrise shall meet let the tumult had subsided the lights had died away within the palace and the stranger whom now recognized stood alone upon the flags shook with inconceivable agitation and his eye glanced around search gondola could not less than offer him the service own and accepted the civility having obtained oar the water
