the purloined letter nil sapienti odiosius acumine nimio seneca paris just after dark one gusty evening the autumn was enjoying the twofold luxury meditation and meerschaum company with friend auguste dupin his little back library book closet troisi rue dun faubourg germain for one hour least had maintained profound silence while each any casual observer might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies smoke that oppressed the atmosphere the chamber for myself however was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between earlier period the evening mean the affair the rue morgue and the mystery attending the murder marie rog looked upon therefore something coincidence when the door our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance monsieur the prefect the parisian police gave him hearty welcome for there was nearly half much the entertaining the contemptible about the man and had not seen him for several years had been sitting the dark and dupin now arose for the purpose lighting lamp but sat down again without doing upon saying that had called consult rather ask the opinion friend about some official business which had occasioned great deal trouble any point requiring reflection observed dupin forebore enkindle the wick shall examine better purpose the dark that another your odd notions said the prefect who had fashion calling every thing odd that was beyond his comprehension and thus lived amid absolute legion oddities very true said dupin supplied his visitor with pipe and rolled towards him comfortable chair and what the difficulty now asked nothing more the assassination way hope nothing that nature the fact the business very simple indeed and make doubt that can manage sufficiently well ourselves but then thought dupin would like hear the details because excessively odd simple and odd said dupin why yes and not exactly that either the fact have all been good deal puzzled because the affair simple and yet baffles altogether perhaps the very simplicity the thing which puts you fault said friend what nonsense you talk replied the prefect laughing heartily perhaps the mystery little too plain said dupin good heavens who ever heard such idea little too self evident roared our visitor profoundly amused dupin you will the death yet and what after all the matter hand asked why will tell you replied the prefect gave long steady and contemplative puff and settled himself his chair will tell you few words but before begin let caution you that this affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that should most probably lose the position now hold were known that confided any one proceed said not said dupin well then have received personal information from very high quarter that certain document the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments the individual who purloined known this beyond doubt was seen take known also that still remains his possession how this known asked dupin clearly inferred replied the prefect from the nature the document and from the non appearance certain results which would once arise from its passing out the robber possession that say from his employing must design the end employ little more explicit said well may venture far say that the paper gives its holder certain power certain quarter where such power immensely valuable the prefect was fond the cant diplomacy still not quite understand said dupin well the disclosure the document third person who shall nameless would bring question the honor personage most exalted station and this fact gives the holder the document ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are jeopardized but this ascendancy interposed would depend upon the robber knowledge the loser knowledge the robber who would dare the thief said the minister who dares all things those unbecoming well those becoming man the method the theft was not less ingenious than bold the document question letter frank had been received the personage robbed while alone the royal boudoir during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted the entrance the other exalted personage from whom especially was her wish conceal after hurried and vain endeavor thrust drawer she was forced place open was upon table the address however was uppermost and the contents thus unexposed the letter escaped notice this juncture enters the minister his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper recognises the handwriting the address observes the confusion the personage addressed and fathoms her secret after some business transactions hurried through his ordinary manner produces letter somewhat similar the one question opens pretends read and then places close juxtaposition the other again converses for some fifteen minutes upon the public affairs length taking leave takes also from the table the letter which had claim its rightful owner saw but course dared not call attention the act the presence the third personage who stood her elbow the minister decamped leaving his own letter one importance upon the table here then said dupin you have precisely what you demand make the ascendancy complete the robber knowledge the loser knowledge the robber yes replied the prefect and the power thus attained has for some months past been wielded for political purposes very dangerous extent the personage robbed more thoroughly convinced every day the necessity reclaiming her letter but this course cannot done openly fine driven despair she has committed the matter than whom said dupin amid perfect whirlwind smoke more sagacious agent could suppose desired even imagined you flatter replied the prefect but possible that some such opinion may have been entertained clear said you observe that the letter still possession the minister since this possession and not any employment the letter which bestows the power with the employment the power departs true said and upon this conviction proceeded first care was make thorough search the minister hotel and here chief embarrassment lay the necessity searching without his knowledge beyond all things have been warned the danger which would result from giving him reason suspect our design but said you are quite fait these investigations the parisian police have done this thing often before yes and for this reason did not despair the habits the minister gave too great advantage frequently absent from home all night his servants are means numerous they sleep distance from their master apartment and being chiefly neapolitans are readily made drunk have keys you know with which can open any chamber cabinet paris for three months night has not passed during the greater part which have not been engaged personally ransacking the hotel honor interested and mention great secret the reward enormous did not abandon the search until had become fully satisfied that the thief more astute man than myself fancy that have investigated every nook and corner the premises which possible that the paper can concealed but not possible suggested that although the letter may possession the minister unquestionably may have concealed elsewhere than upon his own premises this barely possible said dupin the present peculiar condition affairs court and especially those intrigues which known involved would render the instant availability the document its susceptibility being produced moment notice point nearly equal importance with its possession its susceptibility being produced said that say being destroyed said dupin true observed the paper clearly then upon the premises for its being upon the person the minister may consider that out the question entirely said the prefect has been twice waylaid footpads and his person rigorously searched under own inspection you might have spared yourself this trouble said dupin presume not altogether fool and not must have anticipated these waylayings matter course not altogether fool said but then poet which take only one remove from fool true said dupin after long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum although have been guilty certain doggrel myself suppose you detail said the particulars your search why the fact took our time and searched everywhere have had long experience these affairs took the entire building room room devoting the nights whole week each examined first the furniture each apartment opened every possible drawer and presume you know that properly trained police agent such thing secret drawer impossible any man dolt who permits secret drawer escape him search this kind the thing plain there certain amount bulk space accounted for every cabinet then have accurate rules the fiftieth part line could not escape after the cabinets took the chairs the cushions probed with the fine long needles you have seen employ from the tables removed the tops why sometimes the top table other similarly arranged piece furniture removed the person wishing conceal article then the leg excavated the article deposited within the cavity and the top replaced the bottoms and tops bedposts are employed the same way but could not the cavity detected sounding asked means when the article deposited sufficient wadding cotton placed around besides our case were obliged proceed without noise but you could not have removed you could not have taken pieces all articles furniture which would have been possible make deposit the manner you mention letter may compressed into thin spiral roll not differing much shape bulk from large knitting needle and this form might inserted into the rung chair for example you did not take pieces all the chairs certainly not but did better examined the rungs every chair the hotel and indeed the jointings every description furniture the aid most powerful microscope had there been any traces recent disturbance should not have failed detect instantly single grain gimlet dust for example would have been obvious apple any disorder the glueing any unusual gaping the joints would have sufficed insure detection presume you looked the mirrors between the boards and the plates and you probed the beds and the bed clothes well the curtains and carpets that course and when had absolutely completed every particle the furniture this way then examined the house itself divided its entire surface into compartments which numbered that none might missed then scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises including the two houses immediately adjoining with the microscope before the two houses adjoining exclaimed you must have had great deal trouble had but the reward offered prodigious you include the grounds about the houses all the grounds are paved with brick they gave comparatively little trouble examined the moss between the bricks and found undisturbed you looked among papers course and into the books the library certainly opened every package and parcel not only opened every book but turned over every leaf each volume not contenting ourselves with mere shake according the fashion some our police officers also measured the thickness every book cover with the most accurate admeasurement and applied each the most jealous scrutiny the microscope had any the bindings been recently meddled with would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation some five six volumes just from the hands the binder carefully probed longitudinally with the needles you explored the floors beneath the carpets beyond doubt removed every carpet and examined the boards with the microscope and the paper the walls yes you looked into the cellars did then said you have been making miscalculation and the letter not upon the premises you suppose fear you are right there said the prefect and now dupin what would you advise make thorough search the premises that absolutely needless replied not more sure that breathe than that the letter not the hotel have better advice give you said dupin you have course accurate description the letter yes and here the prefect producing memorandum book proceeded read aloud minute account the internal and especially the external appearance the missing document soon after finishing the perusal this description took his departure more entirely depressed spirits than had ever known the good gentleman before about month afterwards paid another visit and found occupied very nearly before took pipe and chair and entered into some ordinary conversation length said well but what the purloined letter presume you have last made your mind that there such thing overreaching the minister confound him say yes made the examination however dupin suggested but was all labor lost knew would how much was the reward offered did you say asked dupin why very great deal very liberal reward don like say how much precisely but one thing will say that wouldn mind giving individual check for fifty thousand francs any one who could obtain that letter the fact becoming more and more importance every day and the reward has been lately doubled were trebled however could more than have done why yes said dupin drawlingly between the whiffs his meerschaum really think you have not exerted yourself the utmost this matter you might little more think how what way why puff puff you might puff puff employ counsel the matter puff puff puff you remember the story they tell abernethy hang abernethy sure hang him and welcome but once upon time certain rich miser conceived the design spunging upon this abernethy for medical opinion getting for this purpose ordinary conversation private company insinuated his case the physician that imaginary individual will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such and such now doctor what would you have directed him take take said abernethy why take advice sure but said the prefect little discomposed perfectly willing take advice and pay for would really give fifty thousand francs any one who would aid the matter that case replied dupin opening drawer and producing check book you may well fill check for the amount mentioned when you have signed will hand you the letter was astounded the prefect appeared absolutely thunder stricken for some minutes remained speechless and motionless looking incredulously friend with open mouth and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets then apparently recovering himself some measure seized pen and after several pauses and vacant stares finally filled and signed check for fifty thousand francs and handed across the table dupin the latter examined carefully and deposited his pocket book then unlocking escritoire took thence letter and gave the prefect this functionary grasped perfect agony joy opened with trembling hand cast rapid glance its contents and then scrambling and struggling the door rushed length unceremoniously from the room and from the house without having uttered syllable since dupin had requested him fill the check when had gone friend entered into some explanations the parisian police said are exceedingly able their way they are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly versed the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly demand thus when detailed his mode searching the premises the hotel felt entire confidence his having made satisfactory investigation far his labors extended far his labors extended said yes said dupin the measures adopted were not only the best their kind but carried out absolute perfection had the letter been deposited within the range their search these fellows would beyond question have found merely laughed but seemed quite serious all that said the measures then continued were good their kind and well executed their defect lay their being inapplicable the case and the man certain set highly ingenious resources are with the prefect sort procrustean bed which forcibly adapts his designs but perpetually errs being too deep too shallow for the matter hand and many schoolboy better reasoner than knew one about eight years age whose success guessing the game even and odd attracted universal admiration this game simple and played with marbles one player holds his hand number these toys and demands another whether that number even odd the guess right the guesser wins one wrong loses one the boy whom allude won all the marbles the school course had some principle guessing and this lay mere observation and admeasurement the astuteness his opponents for example arrant simpleton his opponent and holding his closed hand asks are they even odd our schoolboy replies odd and loses but upon the second trial wins for then says himself the simpleton had them even upon the first trial and his amount cunning just sufficient make him have them odd upon the second will therefore guess odd guesses odd and wins now with simpleton degree above the first would have reasoned thus this fellow finds that the first instance guessed odd and the second will propose himself upon the first impulse simple variation from even odd did the first simpleton but then second thought will suggest that this too simple variation and finally will decide upon putting even before will therefore guess even guesses even and wins now this mode reasoning the schoolboy whom his fellows termed lucky what its last analysis merely said identification the reasoner intellect with that his opponent said dupin and upon inquiring the boy what means effected the thorough identification which his success consisted received answer follows when wish find out how wise how stupid how good how wicked any one what are his thoughts the moment fashion the expression face accurately possible accordance with the expression his and then wait see what thoughts sentiments arise mind heart match correspond with the expression this response the schoolboy lies the bottom all the spurious profundity which has been attributed rochefoucault bougive machiavelli and campanella and the identification said the reasoner intellect with that his opponent depends understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the opponent intellect admeasured for its practical value depends upon this replied dupin and the prefect and his cohort fail frequently first default this identification and secondly ill admeasurement rather through non admeasurement the intellect with which they are engaged they consider only their own ideas ingenuity and searching for anything hidden advert only the modes which they would have hidden they are right this much that their own ingenuity faithful representative that the mass but when the cunning the individual felon diverse character from their own the felon foils them course this always happens when above their own and very usually when below they have variation principle their investigations best when urged some unusual emergency some extraordinary reward they extend exaggerate their old modes practice without touching their principles what for example this case has been done vary the principle action what all this boring and probing and sounding and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface the building into registered square inches what all but exaggeration the application the one principle set principles search which are based upon the one set notions regarding human ingenuity which the prefect the long routine his duty has been accustomed you not see has taken for granted that all men proceed conceal letter not exactly gimlet hole bored chair leg but least some out the way hole corner suggested the same tenor thought which would urge man secrete letter gimlet hole bored chair leg and you not see also that such recherch nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would adopted only ordinary intellects for all cases concealment disposal the article concealed disposal this recherch manner the very first instance presumable and presumed and thus its discovery depends not all upon the acumen but altogether upon the mere care patience and determination the seekers and where the case importance what amounts the same thing the political eyes when the reward magnitude the qualities question have never been known fail you will now understand what meant suggesting that had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits the prefect examination other words had the principle its concealment been comprehended within the principles the prefect its discovery would have been matter altogether beyond question this functionary however has been thoroughly mystified and the remote source his defeat lies the supposition that the minister fool because has acquired renown poet all fools are poets this the prefect feels and merely guilty non distributio medii thence inferring that all poets are fools but this really the poet asked there are two brothers know and both have attained reputation letters the minister believe has written learnedly the differential calculus mathematician and poet you are mistaken know him well both poet and mathematician would reason well mere mathematician could not have reasoned all and thus would have been the mercy the prefect you surprise said these opinions which have been contradicted the voice the world you not mean set naught the well digested idea centuries the mathematical reason has long been regarded the reason par excellence pari replied dupin quoting from chamfort que toute publique toute convention est une sottise car elle convenue plus grand nombre the mathematicians grant you have done their best promulgate the popular error which you allude and which none the less error for its promulgation truth with art worthy better cause for example they have insinuated the term analysis into application algebra the french are the originators this particular deception but term any importance words derive any value from applicability then analysis conveys algebra about much latin ambitus implies ambition religio religion homines honesti set honorable men you have quarrel hand see said with some the algebraists paris but proceed dispute the availability and thus the value that reason which cultivated any especial form other than the abstractly logical dispute particular the reason educed mathematical study the mathematics are the science form and quantity mathematical reasoning merely logic applied observation upon form and quantity the great error lies supposing that even the truths what called pure algebra are abstract general truths and this error egregious that confounded the universality with which has been received mathematical axioms are not axioms general truth what true relation form and quantity often grossly false regard morals for example this latter science very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal the whole chemistry also the axiom fails the consideration motive fails for two motives each given value have not necessarily value when united equal the sum their values apart there are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits relation but the mathematician argues from his finite truths through habit they were absolutely general applicability the world indeed imagines them bryant his very learned mythology mentions analogous source error when says that although the pagan fables are not believed yet forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them existing realities with the algebraists however who are pagans themselves the pagan fables are believed and the inferences are made not much through lapse memory through unaccountable addling the brains short never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could trusted out equal roots one who did not clandestinely hold point his faith that was absolutely and unconditionally equal say one these gentlemen way experiment you please that you believe occasions may occur where not altogether equal and having made him understand what you mean get out his reach speedily convenient for beyond doubt will endeavor knock you down mean say continued dupin while merely laughed his last observations that the minister had been more than mathematician the prefect would have been under necessity giving this check know him however both mathematician and poet and measures were adapted his capacity with reference the circumstances which was surrounded knew him courtier too and bold intriguant such man considered could not fail aware the ordinary policial modes action could not have failed anticipate and events have proved that did not fail anticipate the waylayings which was subjected must have foreseen reflected the secret investigations his premises his frequent absences from home night which were hailed the prefect certain aids his success regarded only ruses afford opportunity for thorough search the police and thus the sooner impress them with the conviction which fact did finally arrive the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises felt also that the whole train thought which was some pains detailing you just now concerning the invariable principle policial action searches for articles concealed felt that this whole train thought would necessarily pass through the mind the minister would imperatively lead him despise all the ordinary nooks concealment could not reflected weak not see that the most intricate and remote recess his hotel would open his commonest closets the eyes the probes the gimlets and the microscopes the prefect saw fine that would driven matter course simplicity not deliberately induced matter choice you will remember perhaps how desperately the prefect laughed when suggested upon our first interview that was just possible this mystery troubled him much account its being very self evident yes said remember his merriment well really thought would have fallen into convulsions the material world continued dupin abounds with very strict analogies the immaterial and thus some color truth has been given the rhetorical dogma that metaphor simile may made strengthen argument well embellish description the principle the vis inerti for example seems identical physics and metaphysics not more true the former that large body with more difficulty set motion than smaller one and that its subsequent momentum commensurate with this difficulty than the latter that intellects the vaster capacity while more forcible more constant and more eventful their movements than those inferior grade are yet the less readily moved and more embarrassed and full hesitation the first few steps their progress again have you ever noticed which the street signs over the shop doors are the most attractive attention have never given the matter thought said there game puzzles resumed which played upon map one party playing requires another find given word the name town river state empire any word short upon the motley and perplexed surface the chart novice the game generally seeks embarrass his opponents giving them the most minutely lettered names but the adept selects such words stretch large characters from one end the chart the other these like the over largely lettered signs and placards the street escape observation dint being excessively obvious and here the physical oversight precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension which the intellect suffers pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self evident but this point appears somewhat above beneath the understanding the prefect never once thought probable possible that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose the whole world way best preventing any portion that world from perceiving but the more reflected upon the daring dashing and discriminating ingenuity upon the fact that the document must always have been hand intended use good purpose and upon the decisive evidence obtained the prefect that was not hidden within the limits that dignitary ordinary search the more satisfied became that conceal this letter the minister had resorted the comprehensive and sagacious expedient not attempting conceal all full these ideas prepared myself with pair green spectacles and called one fine morning quite accident the ministerial hotel found home yawning lounging and dawdling usual and pretending the last extremity ennui perhaps the most really energetic human being now alive but that only when nobody sees him even with him complained weak eyes and lamented the necessity the spectacles under cover which cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment while seemingly intent only upon the conversation host paid especial attention large writing table near which sat and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other papers with one two musical instruments and few books here however after long and very deliberate scrutiny saw nothing excite particular suspicion length eyes going the circuit the room fell upon trumpery fillagree card rack pasteboard that hung dangling dirty blue ribbon from little brass knob just beneath the middle the mantel piece this rack which had three four compartments were five six visiting cards and solitary letter this last was much soiled and crumpled was torn nearly two across the middle design the first instance tear entirely worthless had been altered stayed the second had large black seal bearing the cipher very conspicuously and was addressed diminutive female hand the minister himself was thrust carelessly and even seemed contemptuously into one the uppermost divisions the rack sooner had glanced this letter than concluded that which was search sure was all appearance radically different from the one which the prefect had read minute description here the seal was large and black with the cipher there was small and red with the ducal arms the family here the address the minister diminutive and feminine there the superscription certain royal personage was markedly bold and decided the size alone formed point correspondence but then the radicalness these differences which was excessive the dirt the soiled and torn condition the paper inconsistent with the true methodical habits and suggestive design delude the beholder into idea the worthlessness the document these things together with the hyper obtrusive situation this document full the view every visitor and thus exactly accordance with the conclusions which had previously arrived these things say were strongly corroborative suspicion one who came with the intention suspect protracted visit long possible and while maintained most animated discussion with the minister upon topic which knew well had never failed interest and excite him kept attention really riveted upon the letter this examination committed memory its external appearance and arrangement the rack and also fell length upon discovery which set rest whatever trivial doubt might have entertained scrutinizing the edges the paper observed them more chafed than seemed necessary they presented the broken appearance which manifested when stiff paper having been once folded and pressed with folder refolded reversed direction the same creases edges which had formed the original fold this discovery was sufficient was clear that the letter had been turned glove inside out directed and sealed bade the minister good morning and took departure once leaving gold snuff box upon the table the next morning called for the snuff box when resumed quite eagerly the conversation the preceding day while thus engaged however loud report pistol was heard immediately beneath the windows the hotel and was succeeded series fearful screams and the shoutings terrified mob rushed casement threw open and looked out the meantime stepped the card rack took the letter put pocket and replaced fac simile far regards externals which had carefully prepared lodgings imitating the cipher very readily means seal formed bread the disturbance the street had been occasioned the frantic behavior man with musket had fired among crowd women and children proved however have been without ball and the fellow was suffered his way lunatic drunkard when had gone came from the window whither had followed him immediately upon securing the object view soon afterwards bade him farewell the pretended lunatic was man own pay but what purpose had you asked replacing the letter fac simile would not have been better the first visit have seized openly and departed replied dupin desperate man and man nerve his hotel too not without attendants devoted his interests had made the wild attempt you suggest might never have left the ministerial presence alive the good people paris might have heard more but had object apart from these considerations you know political prepossessions this matter act partisan the lady concerned for eighteen months the minister has had her his power she has now him hers since being unaware that the letter not his possession will proceed with his exactions was thus will inevitably commit himself once his political destruction his downfall too will not more precipitate than awkward all very well talk about the facilis descensus averni but all kinds climbing catalani said singing far more easy get than come down the present instance have sympathy least pity for him who descends that monstrum horrendum unprincipled man genius confess however that should like very well know the precise character his thoughts when being defied her whom the prefect terms certain personage reduced opening the letter which left for him the card rack how did you put any thing particular why did not seem altogether right leave the interior blank that would have been insulting vienna once did evil turn which told him quite good humoredly that should remember knew would feel some curiosity regard the identity the person who had outwitted him thought
