stood about the middle the house and against which had rested the head bed the plastering had here great measure resisted the action the fire fact which attributed its having been recently spread about this wall dense crowd were collected and many persons seemed examining particular portion with very minute and eager attention the words strange singular and other similar expressions excited curiosity approached and saw graven bas relief upon the white surface the figure gigantic cat the impression was given with accuracy truly marvellous there was rope about the animal neck when first

every respect but one pluto had not white hair upon any portion his body but this cat had large although indefinite splotch white covering nearly the whole region the breast upon touching him immediately arose purred loudly rubbed against hand and appeared delighted with notice this then was the very creature which was search once offered purchase the landlord but this person made claim knew nothing had never seen before continued caresses and when prepared home the animal evinced disposition accompany permitted occasionally stooping and patting proceeded when reached the house domesticated itself once and became immediately great favorite with wife for own part soon found dislike arising within this was just the reverse what had anticipated but know not how why was its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed slow degrees these feelings disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness hatred avoided the creature certain sense shame and the remembrance former deed cruelty preventing from physically abusing did not for some weeks strike otherwise violently ill use but gradually very gradually came look upon with unutterable loathing and flee silently
