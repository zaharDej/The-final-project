the cask amontillado the thousand injuries fortunato had borne best could but when ventured upon insult vowed revenge you who well know the nature soul will not suppose however that gave utterance threat length would avenged this was point definitively settled but the very definitiveness with which was resolved precluded the idea risk must not only punish but punish with impunity wrong unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser equally unredressed when the avenger fails make himself felt such him who has done the wrong must understood that neither word nor deed had given fortunato cause doubt good will continued was wont smile his face and did not perceive that smile now was the thought his immolation had weak point this fortunato although other regards was man respected and even feared prided himself his connoisseurship wine few italians have the true virtuoso spirit for the most part their enthusiasm adopted suit the time and opportunity practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires painting and gemmary fortunato like his countrymen was quack but the matter old wines was sincere this respect did not differ from him materially was skilful

cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado thus speaking fortunato possessed himself arm putting mask black silk and drawing roquelaire closely about person suffered him hurry palazzo there were attendants home they had absconded make merry honor the time had told them that should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not stir from the house these orders were sufficient well knew insure their immediate disappearance one and all soon back was turned took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one fortunato bowed him through several suites rooms the archway that led into the vaults passed down long and winding staircase requesting him cautious followed came length the foot the descent and stood together the damp ground the catacombs the montresors the gait friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled strode the pipe said farther said but observe the white web work which gleams from these cavern walls turned towards and looked into eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum intoxication nitre asked length nitre replied how long have you had that cough ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh

alarming you unnecessarily but you should use all proper caution draught this medoc will defend from the damps here knocked off the neck bottle which drew from long row its fellows that lay upon the mould drink said presenting him the wine raised his lips with leer paused and nodded familiarly while his bells jingled drink said the buried that repose around and your long life again took arm and proceeded these vaults said are extensive the montresors replied were great and numerous family forget your arms huge human foot field azure the foot crushes serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded the heel and the motto nemo impune lacessit good said the wine sparkled his eyes and the bells jingled own fancy grew warm with the medoc had passed through walls piled bones with casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses the catacombs paused again and this time made bold seize fortunato arm above the elbow the nitre said see increases hangs like moss upon the vaults are below the river bed the drops moisture trickle among the bones come will back ere too late your cough nothing said let but first another draught the medoc broke and reached him flagon emptied breath his eyes flashed with fierce light laughed and threw the bottle upwards with gesticulation did not understand looked him surprise repeated the movement grotesque one you not comprehend said not replied then you are not the brotherhood how you are not the masons yes yes said yes yes you impossible mason mason replied sign said this answered producing trowel from beneath the folds roquelaire you jest exclaimed recoiling few paces but let proceed the amontillado said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him arm leaned upon heavily continued our route search the amontillado passed through range low arches descended passed and descending again arrived deep crypt which the foulness the air caused our flambeaux rather glow than flame the most remote end the crypt there appeared another less spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled the vault overhead the fashion the great catacombs paris three sides this interior crypt were still ornamented this manner from the fourth the bones had been thrown down and lay promiscuously upon the earth forming one point mound some size within the wall thus exposed the displacing the bones perceived still interior recess depth about four feet width three height six seven seemed have been constructed for especial use itself but formed merely the interval between two the colossal supports the roof the catacombs and was backed one their circumscribing walls solid granite was vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavored pry into the depths the recess its termination the feeble light did not enable see proceed said herein the amontillado for luchesi ignoramus interrupted friend stepped unsteadily forward while followed immediately his heels instant had reached the extremity the niche and finding his progress arrested the rock stood stupidly bewildered moment more and had fettered him the granite its surface were two iron staples distant from each other about two feet horizontally from one these depended short chain from the other padlock throwing the links about his waist was but the work few seconds secure was too much astounded resist withdrawing the key stepped back from the recess pass your hand said over the wall you cannot help feeling the nitre indeed very damp once more let implore you return then must positively leave you but must first render you all the little attentions power the amontillado ejaculated friend not yet recovered from his astonishment true replied the amontillado said these words busied myself among the pile bones which have before spoken throwing them aside soon uncovered quantity building stone and mortar with these materials and with the aid trowel began vigorously wall the entrance the niche had scarcely laid the first tier masonry when discovered that the intoxication fortunato had great measure worn off the earliest indication had this was low moaning cry from the depth the recess was not the cry drunken man there was then long and obstinate silence laid the second tier and the third and the fourth and then heard the furious vibrations the chain the noise lasted for several minutes during which that might hearken with the more satisfaction ceased labors and sat down upon the bones when last the clanking subsided resumed the trowel and finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the seventh tier the wall was now nearly upon level with breast again paused and holding the flambeaux over the mason work threw few feeble rays upon the figure within succession loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the throat the chained form seemed thrust violently back for brief moment hesitated trembled unsheathing rapier began grope with about the recess but the thought instant reassured placed hand upon the solid fabric the catacombs and felt satisfied reapproached the wall replied the yells him who clamored echoed aided surpassed them volume and strength did this and the clamorer grew still was now midnight and task was drawing close had completed the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier had finished portion the last and the eleventh there remained but single stone fitted and plastered struggled with its weight placed partially its destined position but now there came from out the niche low laugh that erected the hairs upon head was succeeded sad voice which had difficulty recognising that the noble fortunato the voice said very good joke indeed excellent jest will have many rich laugh about the palazzo over our wine the amontillado said yes the amontillado but not getting late will not they awaiting the palazzo the lady fortunato and the rest let gone yes said let gone for the love god montressor yes said for the love god but these words hearkened vain for reply grew impatient called aloud fortunato answer called again fortunato answer still thrust torch through the remaining aperture and let fall within there came forth return only jingling the bells heart grew sick account the dampness the catacombs hastened make end labor forced the last stone into its position plastered against the new masonry erected the old rampart bones for the half century mortal has disturbed them pace requiescat
