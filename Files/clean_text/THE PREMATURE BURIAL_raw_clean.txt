offend disgust they are with propriety handled only when the severity and majesty truth sanctify and sustain them thrill for example with the most intense pleasurable pain over the accounts the passage the beresina the earthquake lisbon the plague london the massacre bartholomew the stifling the hundred and twenty three prisoners the black hole calcutta but these accounts the fact the reality the history which excites inventions should regard them with simple abhorrence have mentioned some few the more prominent and august calamities record but these the extent not less than the character the calamity which vividly impresses the fancy need not remind the reader that from the long and weird catalogue human miseries might have selected many individual instances more replete with essential suffering than any these vast generalities disaster the true wretchedness indeed the ultimate woe particular not diffuse that the ghastly extremes agony are endured man the unit and never man the mass for this let thank merciful god buried while alive beyond question the most terrific these extremes which has ever fallen the lot mere mortality that has frequently very frequently fallen will scarcely denied those who think the boundaries which divide life from death are best shadowy and vague who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins know that there are diseases which occur total cessations all the apparent functions vitality and yet which these cessations are merely suspensions properly called they are only temporary pauses the incomprehensible mechanism certain period elapses and some unseen mysterious principle again sets motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels the silver cord was not for ever loosed nor the golden bowl irreparably broken but where meantime was the soul apart however from the inevitable conclusion priori that such causes must produce such effects that the well known occurrence such cases suspended animation must naturally give rise now and then premature interments apart from this consideration have the direct testimony medical and ordinary experience prove that vast number such interments have actually taken

the head its occupant appeared was then seemingly dead but sat nearly erect within his coffin the lid which his furious struggles had partially uplifted was forthwith conveyed the nearest hospital and there pronounced still living although asphytic condition after some hours revived recognized individuals his acquaintance and broken sentences spoke his agonies the grave from what related was clear

wherever was made the subject converse the patient edward stapleton had died apparently typhus fever accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity his medical attendants upon his seeming decease his friends were requested sanction post mortem examination but declined permit often happens when such refusals are made the practitioners resolved disinter the body and dissect leisure private arrangements were easily effected with some the numerous corps body snatchers with which london abounds and upon the third night after the funeral the supposed corpse was unearthed from grave eight feet deep and deposited the opening chamber one the private hospitals incision some extent had been actually made the abdomen when the fresh and undecayed appearance the

fell heavily the floor for some moments all were paralyzed with awe but the urgency the case soon restored them their presence mind was seen that stapleton was alive although swoon upon exhibition ether revived and was rapidly restored health and the society his friends from whom however all knowledge his resuscitation was withheld until relapse was longer apprehended their wonder their rapturous astonishment may conceived the most thrilling peculiarity this incident nevertheless involved what himself asserts declares that period was altogether insensible that dully and confusedly was aware everything which happened him from the moment which was pronounced dead his physicians that which fell swooning the floor the hospital alive were the uncomprehended words which upon recognizing the locality the dissecting room had endeavored his extremity utter were easy matter multiply such histories these but forbear for indeed have need such establish the fact that premature interments occur when reflect how very rarely from the nature the case have our power detect them must admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance scarcely truth graveyard ever encroached upon for any purpose any great extent that skeletons are not found postures which suggest the most fearful suspicions fearful indeed the suspicion but more fearful the doom may asserted without hesitation that event terribly well adapted inspire the supremeness bodily and mental distress burial before death the unendurable oppression the lungs the stifling fumes from the damp earth the clinging the death garments the rigid embrace the narrow house the blackness the absolute night the silence like sea that overwhelms the unseen but palpable presence the conqueror worm these things with the thoughts the air and grass above with memory dear friends who would fly save but informed our fate and with consciousness that this fate they can never informed that our hopeless portion that the really dead these considerations say carry into the heart which still palpitates degree appalling and intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil know nothing agonizing upon earth can dream nothing half hideous the realms the nethermost hell and thus all narratives upon this topic have interest profound interest nevertheless which through the sacred awe the topic itself very properly and very peculiarly depends upon our conviction the truth the matter narrated what have now tell own actual knowledge own positive and personal experience for several years had been subject attacks the singular disorder which physicians have agreed term catalepsy default more definitive title although both the immediate and the predisposing causes and even the actual diagnosis this disease are still mysterious its obvious and apparent character sufficiently well understood its variations seem chiefly degree sometimes the patient lies for day only even for shorter period species exaggerated lethargy senseless and externally motionless but the pulsation the heart still faintly perceptible some traces warmth remain slight color lingers within the centre the cheek and upon application mirror the lips can detect torpid unequal and vacillating action the lungs then again the duration the trance for weeks even for months while the closest scrutiny and the most rigorous medical tests fail establish any material distinction between the state the sufferer and what conceive absolute death very usually saved from premature interment solely the knowledge his friends that has been previously subject catalepsy the consequent suspicion excited and above all the non appearance decay the advances the malady are luckily gradual the first manifestations although marked are unequivocal the fits grow successively more and more distinctive and endure each for longer term than the preceding this lies the principal security from inhumation the unfortunate whose first attack should the extreme character which occasionally seen would almost inevitably consigned alive the tomb own case differed important particular from those mentioned medical books sometimes without any apparent cause sank little little into condition semi syncope half swoon and this condition without pain without ability stir strictly speaking think but with dull lethargic consciousness life and the presence those who surrounded bed remained until the crisis the disease restored suddenly perfect sensation other times was quickly and impetuously smitten grew sick and numb and chilly and dizzy and fell prostrate once then for weeks all was void and black and silent and nothing became the universe total annihilation could more from these latter attacks awoke however with gradation slow proportion the suddenness the seizure just the day dawns the friendless and houseless beggar who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night just tardily just wearily just cheerily came back the light the soul apart from the tendency trance however general health appeared good nor could perceive that was all affected the one prevalent malady unless indeed idiosyncrasy ordinary sleep may looked upon superinduced upon awaking from slumber could never gain once thorough possession senses and always remained for many minutes much bewilderment and perplexity the mental faculties general but the memory especial being condition absolute abeyance all that endured there was physical suffering but moral distress infinitude fancy grew charnel talked worms tombs and epitaphs was lost reveries death and the idea premature burial held continual possession brain the ghastly danger which was subjected haunted day and night the former the torture meditation was excessive the latter supreme when the grim darkness overspread the earth then with every horror thought shook shook the quivering plumes upon the hearse when nature could endure wakefulness longer was with struggle that consented sleep for shuddered reflect that upon awaking might find myself the tenant grave and when finally sank into slumber was only rush once into world phantasms above which with vast sable overshadowing wing hovered predominant the one sepulchral idea from the innumerable images gloom which thus oppressed dreams select for record but solitary vision methought was immersed cataleptic trance more than usual duration and profundity suddenly there came icy hand upon forehead and impatient gibbering voice whispered the word arise within ear sat erect the darkness was total could not see the figure him who had aroused could call mind neither the period which had fallen into the trance nor the locality which then lay while remained motionless and busied endeavors collect thought the cold hand grasped fiercely the wrist shaking petulantly while the gibbering voice said again arise did not bid thee arise and who demanded art thou have name the regions which inhabit replied the voice mournfully was mortal but fiend was merciless but pitiful thou dost feel that shudder teeth chatter speak yet not with the chilliness the night the night without end but this hideousness insufferable how canst thou tranquilly sleep cannot rest for the cry these great agonies these sights are more than can bear get thee come with into the outer night and let unfold thee the graves not this spectacle woe behold looked and the unseen figure which still grasped the wrist had caused thrown open the graves all mankind and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance decay that could see into the innermost recesses and there view the shrouded bodies their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm but alas the real sleepers were fewer many millions than those who slumbered not all and there was feeble struggling and there was general sad unrest and from out the depths the countless pits there came melancholy rustling from the garments the buried and those who seemed tranquilly repose saw that vast number had changed greater less degree the rigid and uneasy position which they had originally been entombed and the voice again said gazed not not pitiful sight but before could find words reply the figure had ceased grasp wrist the phosphoric lights expired and the graves were closed with sudden violence while from out them arose tumult despairing cries saying again not god not very pitiful sight phantasies such these presenting themselves night extended their terrific influence far into waking hours nerves became thoroughly unstrung and fell prey perpetual horror hesitated ride walk indulge any exercise that would carry from home fact longer dared trust myself out the immediate presence those who were aware proneness catalepsy lest falling into one usual fits should buried before real condition could ascertained doubted the care the fidelity dearest friends dreaded that some trance more than customary duration they might prevailed upon regard irrecoverable even went far fear that occasioned much trouble they might glad consider any very protracted attack sufficient excuse for getting rid altogether was vain they endeavored reassure the most solemn promises exacted the most sacred oaths that under circumstances they would bury until decomposition had materially advanced render farther preservation impossible and even then mortal terrors would listen reason would accept consolation entered into series elaborate precautions among other things had the family vault remodelled admit being readily opened from within the slightest pressure upon long lever that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal fly back there were arrangements also for the free admission air and light and convenient receptacles for food and water within immediate reach the coffin intended for reception this coffin was warmly and softly padded and was provided with lid fashioned upon the principle the vault door with the addition springs contrived that the feeblest movement the body would sufficient set liberty besides all this there was suspended from the roof the tomb large bell the rope which was designed should extend through hole the coffin and fastened one the hands the corpse but alas what avails the vigilance against the destiny man not even these well contrived securities sufficed save from the uttermost agonies living inhumation wretch these agonies foredoomed there arrived epoch often before there had arrived which found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first feeble and indefinite sense existence slowly with tortoise gradation approached the faint gray dawn the psychal day torpid uneasiness apathetic endurance dull pain care hope effort then after long interval ringing the ears then after lapse still longer prickling tingling sensation the extremities then seemingly eternal period pleasurable quiescence during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought then brief sinking into non entity then sudden recovery length the slight quivering eyelid and immediately thereupon electric shock terror deadly and indefinite which sends the blood torrents from the temples the heart and now the first positive effort think and now the first endeavor remember and now partial and evanescent success and now the memory has far regained its dominion that some measure cognizant state feel that not awaking from ordinary sleep recollect that have been subject catalepsy and now last the rush ocean shuddering spirit overwhelmed the one grim danger the one spectral and ever prevalent idea for some minutes after this fancy possessed remained without motion and why could not summon courage move dared not make the effort which was satisfy fate and yet there was something heart which whispered was sure despair such other species wretchedness ever calls into being despair alone urged after long irresolution uplift the heavy lids eyes uplifted them was dark all dark knew that the fit was over knew that the crisis disorder had long passed knew that had now fully recovered the use visual faculties and yet was dark all dark the intense and utter raylessness the night that endureth for evermore endeavored shriek and lips and parched tongue moved convulsively together the attempt but voice issued from the cavernous lungs which oppressed the weight some incumbent mountain gasped and palpitated with the heart every elaborate and struggling inspiration the movement the jaws this effort cry aloud showed that they were bound usual with the dead felt too that lay upon some hard substance and something similar sides were also closely compressed far had not ventured stir any limbs but now violently threw arms which had been lying length with the wrists crossed they struck solid wooden substance which extended above person elevation not more than six inches from face could longer doubt that reposed within coffin last and now amid all infinite miseries came sweetly the cherub hope for thought precautions writhed and made spasmodic exertions force open the lid would not move felt wrists for the bell rope was not found and now the comforter fled for ever and still sterner despair reigned triumphant for could not help perceiving the absence the paddings which had carefully prepared and then too there came suddenly nostrils the strong peculiar odor moist earth the conclusion was irresistible was not within the vault had fallen into trance while absent from home while among strangers when how could not remember and was they who had buried dog nailed some common coffin and thrust deep deep and for ever into some ordinary and nameless grave this awful conviction forced itself thus into the innermost chambers soul once again struggled cry aloud and this second endeavor succeeded long wild and continuous shriek yell agony resounded through the realms the subterranean night hillo hillo there said gruff voice reply what the devil the matter now said second get out that said third what you mean yowling that ere kind style like cattymount said fourth and hereupon was seized and shaken without ceremony for several minutes junto very rough looking individuals they did not arouse from slumber for was wide awake when screamed but they restored the full possession memory this adventure occurred near richmond virginia accompanied friend had proceeded upon gunning expedition some miles down the banks the james river night approached and were overtaken storm the cabin small sloop lying anchor the stream and laden with garden mould afforded the only available shelter made the best and passed the night board slept one the only two berths the vessel and the berths sloop sixty twenty tons need scarcely described that which occupied had bedding any kind its extreme width was eighteen inches the distance its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same found matter exceeding difficulty squeeze myself nevertheless slept soundly and the whole vision for was dream and nightmare arose naturally from the circumstances position from ordinary bias thought and from the difficulty which have alluded collecting senses and especially regaining memory for long time after awaking from slumber the men who shook were the crew the sloop and some laborers engaged unload from the load itself came the earthly smell the bandage about the jaws was silk handkerchief which had bound head default customary nightcap the tortures endured however were indubitably quite equal for the time those actual sepulture they were fearfully they were inconceivably hideous but out evil proceeded good for their very excess wrought spirit inevitable revulsion soul acquired tone acquired temper went abroad took vigorous exercise breathed the free air heaven thought upon other subjects than death discarded medical books buchan burned read night thoughts fustian about churchyards bugaboo tales such this short became new man and lived man life from that memorable night dismissed forever charnel apprehensions and with them vanished the cataleptic disorder which perhaps they had been less the consequence than the cause there are moments when even the sober eye reason the world our sad humanity may assume the semblance hell but the imagination man carathis explore with impunity its every cavern alas the grim legion sepulchral terrors cannot regarded altogether fanciful but like the demons whose company afrasiab made his voyage down the oxus they must sleep they will devour they must suffered slumber
