the island the fay nullus enim locus sine genio est servius musique says marmontel those contes moraux which all our translations have insisted upon calling moral tales mockery their spirit musique est seul des talents qui jouissent lui tous les autres veulent des temoins here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them more than any other talent that for music susceptible complete enjoyment where there second party appreciate its exercise and only common with other talents that produces effects which may fully enjoyed solitude the idea which the raconteur has either failed entertain clearly has sacrificed its expression his national love point doubtless the very tenable one that the higher order music the most thoroughly estimated when are exclusively alone the proposition this form will admitted once those who love the lyre for its own sake and for its spiritual uses but there one pleasure still within the reach fallen mortality and perhaps only one which owes even more than does music the accessory sentiment seclusion mean the happiness experienced the contemplation natural scenery truth the man who would behold aright the glory

what the everyday world would not fail term fantastic wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far searching and often solitary and the interest with which have strayed through many dim deep

work zimmerman that solitude est une belle chose mais faut quelqu pour vous dire que solitude est une belle chose the epigram cannot gainsayed but the necessity thing that does not exist was during one lonely journeyings amid far distant region mountain locked within mountain and sad rivers and melancholy tarn writhing sleeping within all that chanced upon certain rivulet and island came upon them suddenly the leafy june and threw myself upon the turf beneath the branches unknown odorous shrub that might doze contemplated the scene felt that thus only should look upon such was the character phantasm which wore all sides save the west where the sun was about sinking arose the verdant walls the forest the little river which turned sharply its course and was thus immediately lost sight seemed have exit from its prison but absorbed the deep green foliage the trees the east while the opposite quarter appeared lay length and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains the sky about midway the short vista which dreamy vision took one small circular island profusely verdured reposed upon the bosom the stream blended bank and shadow there that each seemed pendulous air mirror like was the glassy water that was scarcely possible say what point upon the slope the emerald turf its crystal dominion began position enabled include single view both the eastern and western extremities the islet and observed singularly marked difference their aspects the latter was all one radiant harem garden beauties glowed and blushed beneath the eyes the slant sunlight and fairly laughed with flowers the grass was short springy sweet scented and asphodel interspersed the trees were lithe mirthful erect bright slender and graceful eastern figure and foliage with bark smooth glossy and parti colored there seemed deep sense life and joy about all and although airs blew from out the heavens yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings and fro innumerable butterflies that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings the other eastern end the isle was whelmed the blackest shade sombre yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things the trees were dark color and mournful form and attitude wreathing themselves into sad solemn and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas mortal sorrow and untimely death the grass wore the deep tint the cypress and the heads its blades hung droopingly and hither and thither among were many small unsightly hillocks low and narrow and not very long that had the aspect graves but were not although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered the shade the trees fell heavily upon the water and seemed bury itself therein impregnating the depths the element with darkness fancied that each shadow the sun descended lower and lower separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave birth and thus became absorbed the stream while other shadows issued momently from the trees taking the place their predecessors thus entombed this idea having once seized upon fancy greatly excited and lost myself forthwith revery ever island were enchanted said myself this this the haunt the few gentle fays who remain from the wreck the race are these green tombs theirs they yield their sweet lives mankind yield their own dying they not rather waste away mournfully rendering unto god little little their existence these trees render shadow after shadow exhausting their substance unto dissolution what the wasting tree the water that imbibes its shade growing thus blacker what preys upon may not the life the fay the death which engulfs thus mused with half shut eyes while the sun sank rapidly rest and

might have converted into anything pleased while thus mused appeared that the form one those very fays about whom had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light the western end the island she stood erect singularly fragile canoe and urged with the mere phantom oar while within the influence the lingering sunbeams her attitude seemed indicative joy but sorrow deformed she passed within the shade slowly she glided along and length rounded the islet and entered the region light the revolution which has just been made the fay continued musingly the cycle the brief year her life she has floated through her winter and through her summer she year nearer unto death for did not fail see that she came into the shade her shadow fell from her and was swallowed the dark water making its blackness more black and again the boat appeared and the fay but about the attitude the latter there was more care and uncertainty and less elastic joy she floated again from out the light and into the gloom which deepened momently and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water and became absorbed into its blackness and again and again she made the circuit the island while the sun rushed down his slumbers and each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person while grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct and each passage into the
